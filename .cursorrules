- **Technology**: HTML, Vanilla CSS (strictly NO Tailwind/utility frameworks).
- **Theming**: Use CSS custom properties (variables) for all colors, spacing, and typography.
- **Base URL**: Site is served from `/travel`. Ensure all links and assets use the relative base path.
- **Tone**: Premium, adventurous, visual, and high-impact.
- **Animations**: Use CSS transitions and animations for a smooth, high-end feel.
- **Deployment**: Integrated with GitHub Actions sending to a Debian VPS (Nginx).

## Preferred Patterns
