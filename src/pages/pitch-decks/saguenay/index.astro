      <p>Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean is the “scale upgrade” destination: big landforms, deep water, and those long-view landscapes that photograph like a drone shot even when you’re standing on a trail lookout.</p>
      <p>It’s also naturally good for crowd-avoidance because activities spread across a whole region, not one single hotspot.</p>

      <p>You prefer scenic drives and light walks with strong “reward-to-effort.” This region is built for that: fjord lookouts, accessible sector trailheads, and “do one big view, then go eat something good” days.</p>
      <p>It also respects your home-base preference: one comfortable hotel, then day trips to fjord sectors and Lac-Saint-Jean highlights.</p>
