This is the first post on gnarlybob.net. Nothing fancy — just making sure the pipes work.

## Why write here?

Because the open web deserves more weird personal sites and fewer algorithmic feeds. If you're reading this, you already get it.

## What to expect

Opinions on tech, culture, and whatever else lands. No schedule, no SEO, no analytics. Just words on a page.

```bash
echo "hello world"
```
