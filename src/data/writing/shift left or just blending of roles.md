As I'm reading [Steve Yegge and Gene Kim's Vibe Coding book](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Vibe-Coding/Gene-Kim/9781966280026) (great read, btw - not your "learn to vibe code and get rich" sort of book, but a "holy shit, experienced engineers, this is DIFFERENT" book) I'm realizing that Product Managers can (and probably do) use AI tools to get more into developing the product they have in mind, getting them some proof of concept things up and running quickly. At the same time, experienced developers can now leverage AI for Product vision help because these tools are also fantastic at _that_ job too.
