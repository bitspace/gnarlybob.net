# Rivière-du-Loup, QC --- Consensus Research Report

Five LLM research responses synthesized: Perplexity (Deep Research), Claude.ai, ChatGPT (Deep Research), Gemini (Deep Think), and Mistral (Le Chat).

---

## Executive Summary

All five sources converge on a clear verdict: Rivière-du-Loup is an excellent fit for this couple, with a tight consensus on lodging, daily structure, and core attractions. The agreement is unusually strong on the essentials. There are no fatal flaws. The region delivers what this trip needs --- world-class sunset photography over the widest stretch of the St. Lawrence, beluga whales observable from shore, a flat and accessible coastal landscape, deeply casual food culture, and a properly equipped business-class hotel. The one operational gotcha is significant: **Croisières AML whale-watching cruises from Rivière-du-Loup are not operating in 2026**, eliminating the region's historically marquee activity. The consensus workaround is unanimous --- the Putep't-awt land-based beluga observatory at Cacouna, opened in 2024 by the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk First Nation and named one of Time Magazine's most beautiful places in its first year.

Where sources diverge is on return routing and trip structure. Claude provides the most architecturally differentiated recommendation --- a return route through Quebec's Beauce maple country and Maine's Old Canada Road National Scenic Byway (US-201), producing zero overlap with the outbound Vermont corridor. Gemini provides the most strategically contrarian day-planning recommendation --- flee inland to Lac-Témiscouata on Canada Day to dodge coastal crowds entirely. Perplexity provides the deepest restaurant and attraction coverage with 76 cited references. ChatGPT provides the most actionable day-by-day itinerary with specific addresses, hours, and pricing.

The PEI anchoring bias surfaces in two ways across the sources. First, ChatGPT explicitly frames the Kamouraska/Route 132 drive as "your PEI-loop equivalent day." Second, multiple sources compare the continuous coastal scenery to PEI's coastal loop. The structural reality is different: **RDL is a hub-and-spokes destination, not a continuous loop.** You drive out from a fixed base, explore a spoke (Kamouraska west, Bic east, Cacouna nearby, Témiscouata south, Charlevoix via ferry north), and return each evening. This format actually matches the couple's preferences better than a PEI-style continuous loop --- it eliminates packing and unpacking, allows working mornings at the hotel, and provides the psychological anchor of a familiar room. The scenic driving along Route 132 is comparable in quality to PEI's coastal roads, but the variety of day-trip options (tidal coast, boreal lakes, ferry crossing, maritime museums, whale observation) far exceeds what a single-loop format can offer.

## Trip Format

| Source | Format | Nights at Destination | Travel Days | Intermediate Overnights |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Perplexity | Single day each way | 7 nights | 2 travel days | None |
| Claude.ai | Single day outbound, two-day return | 6 nights + 1 night Jackman ME | 3 travel days | Jackman, Maine (return) |
| ChatGPT | Single day each way | 7 nights | 2 travel days | None |
| Gemini DT | Single day each way | 7 nights | 2 travel days | None |
| Mistral | Split each way | 5 nights | 4 travel days | Quebec City (outbound + return) |

**Consensus: 4-1 in favor of single-day drives each way.** The distance is ~380 miles / 610 km / 6.5-7.5 hours. Four of five sources agree this is a comfortable single-day drive giving 7 full nights at destination. Only Mistral recommends splitting with Quebec City overnights, which compresses destination time to 5 nights --- an unnecessary sacrifice given the couple's demonstrated comfort with 7-8 hour driving days.

**Claude's two-day return is the structural outlier worth considering.** Rather than retracing the Vermont/I-91 outbound route, Claude routes the return through Quebec's Beauce country (Route 173) to the remote Armstrong/Jackman border crossing, then south on US-201 (the Old Canada Road National Scenic Byway) through pristine Maine wilderness. The trade-off is one night at destination sacrificed for a return journey through completely different terrain. The Jackman overnight splits a 9.5-hour return into two manageable legs (5.5 hours + 4.5 hours) and adds the Attean Pond Overlook, Moxie Falls, and Wyman Lake as return-day highlights.

**The hub-and-spokes format is unanimous (excluding Mistral's structure).** All four substantive sources design the trip around a single base hotel with daily excursions radiating outward. This is structurally simpler than the Saguenay two-base strategy and appropriate for RDL, where all major attractions fall within 90 minutes of the hotel.

> **My take:** Single-day drive each way, 7 nights at destination. Claude's Beauce/Old Canada Road return is the premium option if you want zero route overlap and are willing to trade one destination night for a spectacular driving day through Maine wilderness. The trade-off is real but favorable --- you gain the Attean Pond Overlook (one of Maine's finest panoramas) and US-201 (a designated National Scenic Byway through unbroken forest along the Kennebec River). If you want maximum time at destination, take the Vermont/I-91 corridor both ways --- it works fine and the couple knows I-91 well.

## Scenic Routes

### Outbound

| Route | Recommended By | Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| **I-93 N to I-91 N to Derby Line, A-55/A-20 to Route 132 E scenic finish** | Perplexity, Claude, Gemini | Vermont Northeast Kingdom; Eastern Townships; Route 132 coastal finale through Kamouraska; ~7.5-8.5 hrs with scenic detour |
| **I-93 N to I-89 N to I-91 N, same Quebec routing** | ChatGPT | Adds I-89 segment through central Vermont; slightly different NH-VT transition |
| **I-93 N to I-91 N to A-40 E (via Montreal corridor)** | Mistral | Routes through Montreal/A-40 rather than A-55/A-20; adds congestion risk for no scenic benefit |

**Consensus: The Vermont/I-91/Derby Line corridor is universal.** All five sources cross at Derby Line/Stanstead. The only meaningful divergence is whether to take A-20 straight to RDL (faster) or exit at Montmagny for the **Route 132 scenic finish** (adds ~45 minutes but transforms the arrival into a genuine coastal driving experience through Kamouraska and the heritage villages of the Côte-du-Sud).

**The Route 132 scenic finish is the consensus recommendation (3/5 sources).** Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini all route the final 130 km on Route 132 rather than A-20. Claude frames it well: this two-lane highway hugs the south shore through Saint-Jean-Port-Joli (Quebec's wood-carving capital), Kamouraska, and into Rivière-du-Loup with continuous estuary views, island-dotted horizons, and charming stone villages.

### Return

| Route | Recommended By | Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| **A-20 W to A-73 S to Route 173 S (Beauce) to US-201 S (Old Canada Road) to I-95** | Claude, Gemini | Terrasse de Lévis viewpoint; Beauce maple country; remote Armstrong/Jackman border; 78 miles of Kennebec River wilderness; Attean Pond Overlook |
| **A-85 S to Edmundston NB to Route 2 S to Houlton ME to I-95** | Perplexity, ChatGPT | Témiscouata Lake country; Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!; New Brunswick border crossing; I-95 through Maine |
| **Reverse outbound via Quebec City** | Mistral | No new terrain; Quebec City overnight |

**Consensus: 2-2-1 split, with the Beauce/Old Canada Road as the higher-value option.** Claude and Gemini both route through Route 173 and US-201; Perplexity and ChatGPT route through Edmundston and I-95. Both avoid retracing the outbound. Mistral simply reverses the outbound, offering nothing new.

**Claude's Old Canada Road pitch is the strongest return-route recommendation.** US-201 is a designated National Scenic Byway following the Kennebec River for 78 miles through unbroken wilderness --- Benedict Arnold marched this exact route in 1775. The Attean Pond Overlook near Jackman delivers sweeping views of the Moose River Valley from a drive-up rest area. Claude adds two critical safety notes: never drive US-201 at dusk or dawn (prime moose habitat), and fill your tank in Jackman (next gas 60 miles south in Bingham).

**The Edmundston/I-95 return (Perplexity, ChatGPT) is the practical alternative.** It passes through the Témiscouata lake country and the memorably named Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha! (the only municipality in the world with two exclamation marks). More highway driving, less scenic drama, but no overnight required.

> **My take:** Outbound via I-91/Derby Line with the Route 132 scenic finish through Kamouraska. Return via Claude's Beauce/Old Canada Road through Jackman, ME with an overnight split. Zero overlap, three completely different landscape profiles (Vermont mountains to Quebec coastal villages on the way up; Quebec maple country to Maine boreal wilderness on the way back). If the extra night in Jackman is a dealbreaker, use the Edmundston/I-95 return instead --- it's a solid single-day option through different terrain than the outbound.

## Lodging

### Primary Recommendation

**Hôtel Levesque, Rivière-du-Loup** --- recommended by Perplexity, Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini as the primary pick. Mistral is the lone dissenter, leading with Auberge de la Pointe.

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| Address | 171 Rue Fraser, Rivière-du-Loup, QC G5R 1E2 |
| Rate | ~$180-250 CAD/night (~$130-180 USD) for river-view Aqua room |
| Internet | Free high-speed WiFi throughout; business center with 3 desks, printers --- infrastructure built for conference/business use |
| Gym | Fitness room (2 treadmills, elliptical, exercise bike, weights, weight bench); open 6 AM-10 PM |
| Pool | Indoor heated pool with river views |
| Spa | L'Estuaire Health Centre / Nordic spa services |
| Room | Refrigerator, some rooms with microwave; Starbucks in lobby |
| Restaurants | La Griffe (upscale Québécois with river views), Le 171 Resto-Bar Terrasse (casual with terrace) |
| Parking | Free on-site; 3 Tesla + 2 regular EV chargers |
| Privacy | 110-room 4-star hotel (Ôrigine artisans hôteliers group); not a B&B |
| Rating | 8.0-8.5/10 on Booking.com and KAYAK; TripAdvisor #2 of 15 hotels in RDL, Travelers' Choice award |

**Why it wins (4/5 sources agree):** The combination of business-grade WiFi infrastructure (conference center + business center), proper fitness facilities, and river-view rooms with balconies makes this the clear working-vacation hotel. Gemini adds the critical insight: "Your wife can literally set up her tripod on the balcony and photograph world-class sunsets over the river while you work." Claude frames the privacy advantage: it's a proper hotel with a Do Not Disturb sign, not a social B&B format.

**The "Vue Fleuve" hack (Gemini):** Request an odd-numbered river-view room or suite for panoramic St. Lawrence views from floor-to-ceiling windows. The sunset from your room is a legitimate photography experience --- the hotel faces west-northwest, directly toward the setting sun behind the Charlevoix mountains.

### Runner-Up: Hôtel Universel

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| Address | 311 Boul. Hôtel-de-Ville |
| Rate | ~$170-220 CAD/night |
| Gym | 24-hour fitness center |
| Pool | Indoor pool with waterslide, hot tub |
| Spa | UniverSpa Nordik (outdoor Nordic spa with hot/cold plunges, steam, sauna; ~$40/couple surcharge) |
| Room | All rooms include fridge, microwave, coffee maker |
| Restaurant | Boréal on-site |
| Size | 300 rooms, 4-star --- the largest hotel in town |

**Claude ranks this as runner-up, Mistral includes it.** The 24-hour gym is the strongest fitness option in town. The trade-off: reviews describe a "maze-like" sprawling complex, the gym reportedly lacks air conditioning, and it's farther from walkable dining.

### Alternative: Auberge de la Pointe

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| Address | 10 Boul. Cartier |
| Rate | ~$113-250 CAD/night |
| Amenities | Indoor pool, hot tub, sauna, spa, fitness center, free WiFi; 107 rooms across 7 pavilions |
| Restaurant | L'Espadon (seafood) |
| Distinction | 69 rooms with private balconies and river views; closer to ferry wharf |

**Mistral's top pick, Perplexity's alternative.** More "destination hotel" than "business hotel." Claude advises confirming desk ergonomics and WiFi consistency before committing, since the couple works remotely.

### Why B&Bs and Cabins Don't Work

Gemini states this most directly: "Do not book a charming, secluded B&B. B&Bs fail your privacy constraints (chatty hosts, forced communal breakfasts), they lack fitness centers, and rural rentals in Quebec notoriously rely on spotty satellite internet." All five sources implicitly or explicitly agree by recommending only hotels.

> **My take:** Hôtel Levesque is the unambiguous answer. The river-view room with balcony sunset photography, business-grade WiFi, on-site fitness, and two restaurants make it the best working-vacation option in the region. The Starbucks in the lobby is a surprisingly valuable amenity for morning routine consistency. Book a river-view Aqua room for the full week. Hôtel Universel is the fallback if Levesque is fully booked --- the 24-hour gym is better, but everything else trades down.

---

## The Signature Experience: Sunsets Over the St. Lawrence

All five sources agree: the defining visual experience of Rivière-du-Loup is the sunset. The St. Lawrence here is 15 km wide --- close enough to see the Charlevoix mountains across the water, far enough to feel oceanic. The south shore faces northwest, directly into the setting sun. National Geographic has cited this specific stretch as having some of the most beautiful sunsets in the world (second only to Hawaii, per one frequently referenced ranking).

### Why the Sunsets Work Here

The combination of factors is unusual: (1) the 15 km width creates an ocean-like horizon with reflected light; (2) the Charlevoix mountains across the water provide a silhouetted ridgeline; (3) the 3-5 metre tidal range exposes textured mudflats and glacial boulders at low water, adding foreground interest that changes twice daily; (4) at latitude 47.8°N in early July, golden hour is extremely long and civil twilight extends to ~9:15 PM.

### The Three Sunset Locations

**Parc de la Pointe** --- all five sources recommend as the primary sunset location. A 5 km paved waterfront loop right in town, completely flat, free admission, tripod-friendly throughout. Wide-angle panoramas of Île aux Lièvres, the Charlevoix mountains, and the setting sun. Heritage villas line the shore. This is the "walk out, shoot, walk back" location that requires zero planning or logistics.

**Notre-Dame-du-Portage wharf** --- Perplexity, Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini recommend. A 10-minute drive west of RDL. Designated one of Quebec's "Most Beautiful Villages." The municipal wharf is legendary for sunset photography. The scent of salt water and seaweed is unmistakable. The Charlevoix mountains across the river go through spectacular color shifts as the sun drops. Perplexity adds the critical timing: arrive by 7:30 PM; sunset ~8:40 PM; stay through blue hour (~9:15-9:45 PM).

**Kamouraska Quay** --- Perplexity, ChatGPT, Gemini recommend. A 40-minute drive west. The sunset here is framed by the cabourons (glacial monadnocks) and the Kamouraska Islands offshore. ChatGPT specifies: arrive one hour before sunset for best light. Weekday mornings are best for sunrise; avoid weekends when the village gets busy.

> **My take:** Parc de la Pointe is your first-night and every-night sunset anchor --- it's 5 minutes from the hotel, completely flat, and requires no decisions. Notre-Dame-du-Portage is the upgrade when you want a different composition. Kamouraska is the sunset-with-a-day-trip option. You will have 7 evenings; use at least 4 of them for sunset photography. The light at this latitude in early July is genuinely extraordinary.

- Book in advance --- places are limited
- Accessibility: 7/10 (with shuttle), 5/10 (without shuttle)
- Photography: 8/10

**Kamouraska Village and Route 132** --- all five sources recommend the westward coastal drive.
- 47 km west of RDL (~40 minutes); Quebec's first designated grand paysage culturel patrimonial
- Famous for cabourons (glacial monadnocks), stone heritage architecture, artisan food shops
- Walk the flat main street (Avenue Morel) past heritage buildings, galleries, and food shops
- **Boulangerie Niemand:** legendary artisan bread and German-style pastries (ChatGPT)
- **La Fée Gourmande:** fine chocolates (ChatGPT)
- **Poissonnerie Lauzier:** smoked eel --- the region's signature delicacy, fished here for centuries (all sources)
- Route 132 between Kamouraska and RDL offers continuous estuary views, tidal flat photography, and historic stone villages

**Parc des Chutes (Falls Park), downtown RDL** --- Perplexity, Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini recommend.
- 33-metre waterfall in the heart of town, viewable from footbridges spanning the gorge
- Free admission, free parking at top and bottom
- **Gemini's mobility hack:** Drive directly to the upper parking lot (via Rue Frontenac or Rue Beaubien). It is a flat, 5-minute walk to the suspension footbridge directly over the waterfall. Do NOT park at the bottom and climb the 800-step gorge trail
- Morning light illuminates the falls directly (gorge faces east-west)
- ND filter essential for silky water; polarizer for spray; tripod-friendly footbridges
- Accessibility: 8/10 (from upper parking lot)
- Photography: 8/10

**Parc de la Pointe (Waterfront Promenade)** --- all five sources recommend.
- 5 km paved loop right in town; dead flat; free admission
- Swings for people with reduced mobility; wheelchair-accessible viewpoints
- Heritage villas, shoreline curves, river textures
- Île aux Lièvres dominates the view across the water with Charlevoix mountains beyond
- The primary sunset location (see Sunset section above)
- Accessibility: 10/10
- Photography: 9/10

**Site historique maritime de la Pointe-au-Père** --- Perplexity, Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini recommend.
- 110 km east of RDL (~75 min), near Rimouski
- Three attractions in one: Empress of Ireland Museum (1 hour), HMCS Onondaga submarine (45 min), Pointe-au-Père Lighthouse (Quebec's 2nd tallest, 33m)
- Empress of Ireland: Canada's worst maritime disaster (1,012 dead in 14 minutes, May 29, 1914). Over 200 artifacts, immersive multimedia. Genuinely moving
- Submarine involves climbing through hatches and narrow passages --- assess comfort level

- **Verify 2026 submarine status** --- Claude notes it was scheduled to close for major work in late 2025
- Best rainy-day destination in the region
- Accessibility: 7/10 (campus is flat and paved; submarine and lighthouse require physical effort)
- Photography: 8/10

### Tier 2: Strong Agreement (3-4 sources recommend)

**Charlevoix Ferry Day Trip** --- Perplexity, Claude, ChatGPT recommend explicitly; Gemini implies.
- Rivière-du-Loup to Saint-Siméon ferry: 65-70 minutes crossing, 2-4 departures/day
- No reservations accepted for cars --- first come, first served; arrive 90 minutes early
- Cost: ~$102 CAD one-way for car + 2 adults
- The ferry itself is a whale-watching platform through the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park
- From Saint-Siméon, drive Route 138 west to La Malbaie, then Route 362 (Route du Fleuve) through Les Éboulements to Baie-Saint-Paul --- one of the most scenic drives in North America
- Build in margin for return ferry; **missing the last ferry means being stranded on the north shore**
- Best on a weekday to avoid Saturday peak-season lines
- Allow a full day

**Musée du Bas-Saint-Laurent** --- Perplexity, ChatGPT, Gemini recommend.
- 300 Rue Saint-Pierre, downtown RDL
- Contemporary art and regional history; 250,000+ regional historical photographs

### Tier 3: Notable Mentions

| Site | Source | Key Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Jardins de Métis / Reford Gardens** | Perplexity, ChatGPT | 3,000 plant species including famed Himalayan blue poppy; International Garden Festival; 150 km east of RDL; 2-3 hours on-site; fully paved/gravel paths. Macro photography paradise |
| **Île Verte** | Claude, ChatGPT | Oldest lighthouse on the St. Lawrence (1809, National Historic Site); 28 permanent residents; ferry required (reservations by phone: 418-898-2843); minke whales feed meters from western point |
| **Fort Ingall** | Claude, ChatGPT | Reconstructed 1839 British fort in Témiscouata; 9 buildings inside wooden palisade; costumed guides; flat, accessible grounds; fully bilingual |
| **Fromagerie des Basques** | Claude, ChatGPT | Voted Quebec's best cheese curds; Route 132, Trois-Pistoles; squeaky-fresh fromage en grains |
| **Fromagerie Perron** | ChatGPT | Quebec's oldest fromagerie (1895); 4-year aged cheddar; Saint-Prime |
| **Manoir Fraser** | ChatGPT, Gemini | Restored 1830 seigneurial residence in RDL; self-guided tours daily 9:30-5 PM; $10 CAD |
| **Station exploratoire du Saint-Laurent** | Claude, ChatGPT | Waterfront marine wildlife interpretation centre with touch tanks |
| **Saint-Jean-Port-Joli** | Perplexity, Claude | Wood-carving capital of Quebec; Bourgault family tradition since the 1930s; galleries and shops along main road; on Route 132 outbound |
| **Domaine Acer** | Claude | Maple wines and sparkling maple aperitifs; guided tours of sugar bush; Témiscouata region |
| **Parc côtier Kiskotuk** | Perplexity, ChatGPT | Free coastal park with ~20 km of trails across salt marshes, boreal forest, and shoreline; Indigenous culture interpretation; Cacouna/L'Isle-Verte |

### Skip (consensus)

**Croisières AML whale cruises** --- NOT operating from RDL in 2026. Perplexity flags this clearly. Mistral incorrectly recommends them.

**Tadoussac as a day trip** --- Mistral recommends a 200 km each-way drive to Tadoussac for whale watching. All other sources agree this is too far from RDL for a day trip and unnecessary given the Putep't-awt beluga observatory at Cacouna (15 minutes away).

**Charlevoix mountain parks (Hautes-Gorges, Grands-Jardins)** --- Mistral recommends a "121 km loop" through these parks as a day drive from RDL. This is geographically implausible --- these parks are on the north shore of the St. Lawrence, requiring a ferry crossing each way, and are 3+ hours from RDL. Not a realistic day trip.

> **My take:** Parc national du Bic at low tide is the must-do. Time it around tides, not time of day. Putep't-awt is the must-experience --- book the shuttle, bring the long lens, and prepare for genuine cultural depth from the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk guides. Kamouraska fills a full morning of photography and food shopping. The Charlevoix ferry day is the grand adventure --- do it on a weekday and treat the ferry itself as a whale-watching platform. Pointe-au-Père is your rainy-day ace. And every single evening, walk to Parc de la Pointe for sunset.

---

## The Whale Question

### The Critical 2026 Gotcha

**Croisières AML whale-watching cruises from Rivière-du-Loup are not operating in 2026.** Perplexity surfaces this directly with a citation from the Tourisme Bas-Saint-Laurent listing. This was historically the region's marquee marine activity. Mistral recommends them without noting the cancellation --- a significant factual error.

### The Consensus Workaround: Land-Based Beluga Observation

Four of five sources converge on the **Putep't-awt observatory at Cacouna** as the primary whale-watching replacement. Opened in June 2024, it provides land-based beluga viewing from a modern observation platform atop Gros-Cacouna mountain, developed and operated by the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk First Nation. The electric shuttle eliminates most of the 2 km uphill walk.

**Why it works for this couple:** No boat (eliminating seasickness risk, social density of tour groups, and fixed departure times). No booking a specific time slot for the ferry. A cultural experience layered on top of a wildlife experience. And belugas surface close to the Cacouna shore --- this area is critical summer habitat for the endangered St. Lawrence beluga population (~1,850 animals), with females and calves concentrated here from late June through September.

### Additional Beluga Viewing

**RDL ferry wharf and marina** --- Claude notes belugas are seen from the wharf daily. White forms appear 200-1,000m from shore. A 400mm+ telephoto lens is needed from this distance. Drive-up, paved, no admission --- this is the "check every morning while having coffee" option.

**The Charlevoix ferry crossing** --- Perplexity, Claude, and ChatGPT note the ferry sails through the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park. Belugas, fin whales, and minke whales are possible during the 65-minute crossing. Bring binoculars.

> **My take:** The AML cruise cancellation sounds like a loss, but the Putep't-awt replacement is arguably a better fit for this couple. A land-based observatory with Indigenous cultural programming, no fixed departure time, and an electric shuttle beats a crowded boat tour for crowd-averse travelers. Book the shuttle in advance. Bring the longest telephoto lens available. And check the wharf every morning --- sometimes the belugas come to you.

## Indigenous Heritage

### The Anchor: Putep't-awt and the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk

The Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk First Nation is the only Wolastoqey (Maliseet) community in Quebec, with ~570 members based at Cacouna and Kataskomiq. Their territory historically connected the St. Lawrence to the Bay of Fundy via the lake and river systems of the Témiscouata region --- a corridor used for millennia. The opening of Putep't-awt in 2024 represents a major step in the Nation's effort to share its heritage with visitors on its own terms.

**The Putep't-awt experience (described in detail in Tier 1 above):** Interpretive panels with artistic engravings and QR codes linking to Indigenous stories narrated by community members. The Matuweskewin gift shop showcases authentic Wolastoqey crafts. Cultural programming includes guided experiences and evening tales and legends programs.

**Maqahamok Pub, Cacouna** --- Gemini uniquely surfaces this Indigenous-owned restaurant near Putep't-awt: wood-fired pizzas, smoked meats, excellent non-alcoholic mocktails. Highly casual. ~$20 USD.

### Additional Indigenous Context

| Site | Source | Key Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Parc national du Lac-Témiscouata** | Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini | 62 archaeological sites spanning nearly 10,000 years; rabaska canoe excursions; stone tool workshops; participation in real archaeological digs |
| **Parc côtier Kiskotuk** | Perplexity, ChatGPT | Free coastal park with Indigenous culture interpretation |
| **Circuit Patrimonial de Notre-Dame-du-Portage** | Perplexity | The historic "Grand Portage Trail" used by Maliseet, Micmac, Abenaki, and Montagnais nations for millennia |
| **Route 132 Indigenous place names** | Perplexity, ChatGPT | Kamouraska (Mi'gmaq), Pohénégamook (Abenaki), Témiscouata (Mi'gmaq), Rimouski (Mi'gmaq) --- the landscape is narrated in Indigenous languages |

> **My take:** Putep't-awt is not optional --- it is one of the strongest cultural experiences in the entire region regardless of subject matter. Pair it with lunch at Maqahamok Pub for a full Indigenous heritage morning. If the Témiscouata inland day happens (Canada Day or otherwise), the park's archaeological programming adds a completely different layer of Indigenous history --- 10,000 years of continuous habitation in a landscape that looks nothing like the coast.

## July Conditions --- All Sources Agree

| Factor | Consensus |
|---|---|
| Temperature | Highs 21-23°C (70-73°F); lows 13-15°C (55-59°F); cooler than New Hampshire thanks to the estuary's maritime influence |
| Humidity | 78-89% average but at these temperatures feels comfortable, not oppressive; constant breeze off the St. Lawrence |
| Rain | ~38% chance on any given day; showers tend to be brief; can produce dramatic post-rain light for photography |
| Sunrise/Sunset | ~4:43-4:58 AM / ~8:39-8:49 PM EDT (~16 hours daylight) |
| Crowds | Early July is start of peak season but BEFORE Quebec's Construction Holiday (mid-to-late July); moderate at most |
| Bugs | Blackflies largely finished by early July; mosquitoes moderate at dawn/dusk; coastal areas are naturally wind-swept |

### Bug Assessment

**Blackflies are finished by early July** (Gemini, Claude confirm). Peak season ends in late June. **Mosquitoes are moderate** --- active at dawn and dusk, especially inland near standing water. Coastal areas benefit from constant wind. **Bug mitigation:** DEET-based repellent (25-30%, buy in the US); Thermacell device (popular among Canadian outdoors enthusiasts); long sleeves for evening waterside photography. Claude's assessment: bugs are a minor nuisance rather than a serious problem during this window.

### Crowd Strategy

**Canada Day (July 1, 2026) is the one crowd spike.** Coastal towns will have festivities. Gemini's strategy is the most actionable: flee inland to Lac-Témiscouata. All sources agree that early July falls before the Construction Holiday crush (last two weeks of July), which is the real peak.

**The Dawn Patrol advantage:** At latitude 47.8°N, sunrise is ~4:45 AM. That is 3+ hours before parks and attractions get busy. Every source agrees: use the extreme daylight to shoot in prime light while most visitors are asleep.

### Language

**This is deeply francophone Quebec.** RDL is approximately 99% francophone --- more French than most places American tourists encounter in Quebec. All five sources agree on the approach:
- Start every interaction with "Bonjour"
- Hotels, major museums, and national parks will have some bilingual staff
- Small restaurants, casse-croûtes, and rural shops may be French-only
- Download Google Translate's offline French pack before the trip
- Locals are warmly welcoming; a butchered attempt at French goes further than starting with "Hello"

**Gemini's honest anxiety assessment:** "If you smile and offer a butchered 'Bonjour,' they will happily use hand gestures to help you without making you feel anxious."

> **My take:** The language situation is manageable and the same as the Saguenay assessment. The couple's functional French from previous Quebec trips is exactly the right baseline. Key restaurant vocabulary: guédille (lobster/shrimp roll), poutine (poutine), casse-croûte (roadside snack bar), fromage en grains (cheese curds), anguille fumée (smoked eel). The warmth of Bas-Saint-Laurent locals is legendary and will compensate for any linguistic friction.

## Photography Guidance --- Consensus

### Signature Subjects

The region delivers a distinctive visual palette found nowhere else in eastern North America: massive tidal range (3-5 metres), island-studded estuary views, historic lighthouses, marine wildlife, and sunsets routinely described as the most beautiful in Canada.

| Subject | Where | When | Gear |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sunset over the St. Lawrence** | Parc de la Pointe; Notre-Dame-du-Portage wharf; Kamouraska Quay | 7:30-9:45 PM; arrive 1 hour before sunset | Tripod, wide-angle, graduated ND; telephoto for Charlevoix mountain detail |
| **Tidal flat patterns** | L'Isle-Verte salt marshes (Sentier de la Spartine, 0.8 km flat); Kamouraska aboiteaux | 1-2 hours before lowest tide | Wide-angle for foreground texture; ND filters (6-10 stop) for long exposures; waterproof boots |
| **Seals on rocks** | Pointe aux Épinettes, Parc national du Bic | Low tide | 400-600mm telephoto; patience; flat cycling trail access |
| **Belugas from shore** | Putep't-awt observatory; RDL ferry wharf | Morning (belugas most active) | 400-600mm telephoto; tripod on observatory platform |
| **Waterfall** | Parc des Chutes, downtown RDL | Morning (gorge faces east-west) | Tripod, 3-6 stop ND filter for silky water; polarizer for spray |
| **Coastal headlands and coves** | Chemin-du-Nord trail, Parc national du Bic | Sunrise or low-tide morning | Wide-angle for panoramas; ND filter for seascapes |
| **Lighthouses** | Pointe-au-Père (drive-up); Île Verte (ferry required); RDL wharf light | Any clear day; fog for mood | Standard zoom for context; telephoto for isolation |
| **Route du Fleuve vistas** | Route 362 pull-offs, Charlevoix (ferry day) | Morning eastbound | Wide-angle; multiple roadside pull-offs |
| **Cabourons and estuary** | Kamouraska Quay and Route 132 pull-offs | Sunrise (~5:00 AM) or sunset | Wide-angle for monadnock silhouettes; telephoto for compression |

### Tidal Photography Planning (Claude's unique contribution)

The tidal range at Rivière-du-Loup reaches **3-5 metres** between high and low water. Spring tides (greatest range) occur 1-2 days after new and full moons. In early July 2026, the new moon falls around June 25 and the full moon around July 10 --- meaning the June 29-July 3 window has moderately large tidal ranges that diminish toward neap tides mid-week, then build again. Consult tides.gc.ca Station 03130 for precise daily predictions. Two high and two low tides occur daily, shifting ~50 minutes later each day.

**The practical takeaway:** Plan Bic seal-viewing and Kamouraska tidal-flat photography around low tides specifically. The visual difference between high and low tide is dramatic --- hundreds of metres of exposed mudflat, rock shelf, and tidal pools.

### Gear (universal agreement)

- **Circular polarizer** --- cuts water glare on the estuary, deepens sky; essential for mid-day shooting
- **Graduated ND (hard-edge)** --- sunset sky/water balance over the wide estuary
- **6-10 stop ND filter** --- long-exposure water at Parc des Chutes and tidal flats
- **Wide-angle (16-35mm)** --- sunset panoramas, waterfall, coastal headlands
- **Standard zoom (24-70mm)** --- village compositions, lighthouse context, general landscapes
- **Telephoto (70-200mm)** --- Charlevoix mountain compression, lighthouse isolation, island detail
- **Super telephoto (400-600mm)** --- seals at Bic, belugas from shore, seabirds
- **Tripod** --- every recommended location has flat, tripod-friendly surfaces; wind off the river demands a sturdy tripod with weight hook
- **Rain sleeve for camera body** --- showers are frequent and brief
- **Waterproof boots** --- essential for tidal flat exploration
- **Binoculars** --- for spotting wildlife before committing the camera

### The Top 5 Photography Locations, Ranked for Non-Hikers

1. **Parc de la Pointe at sunset** --- the signature shot, zero effort, repeatable every evening
2. **Parc national du Bic at low tide** --- seals, coves, headlands; the highest photographic density per mile
3. **Putep't-awt observatory** --- belugas + panoramic estuary view from a stable platform
4. **Notre-Dame-du-Portage wharf at sunset** --- the upgrade composition with village and estuary
5. **Parc des Chutes in morning light** --- the waterfall shot, 5 minutes from parking

> **My take:** The tidal flat patterns at low water are this trip's underappreciated opportunity. Claude uniquely identifies the L'Isle-Verte salt marshes (Sentier de la Spartine) as a graphic abstract composition location --- receding water over textured spartina grass and mud. This kind of image doesn't exist anywhere else in the couple's usual territory. Bring waterproof boots and an ND filter, and plan this around the tide table. Everything else on the list is well-known; the tidal patterns are the discovery.

## Dining --- Consensus Rankings

### The Regional Essentials

| Specialty | What It Is | Where to Find It |
|---|---|---|
| **Anguille fumée (smoked eel)** | Kamouraska's signature delicacy; fished here for centuries by both Indigenous peoples and French settlers | Poissonnerie Lauzier, Kamouraska |
| **Crevettes nordiques (Nordic shrimp)** | Sweet, small, abundant; served in guédilles (rolls) and soups | Cantine Côtière (Saint-Fabien); Bistro de la Mer (Kamouraska) |
| **Poutine with local curds** | Made with cheese curds from regional fromageries; curds should squeak | Casse-Croûte Mini-Putt and Snack Bar D'Amours (RDL); Fromagerie des Basques (Trois-Pistoles) |
| **Guédille au homard** | Lobster roll, Quebec-style, in a steamed bun | Poissonnerie Lauzier; Grand'Ourse cantine (Kamouraska) |
| **Fromage en grains** | Fresh cheese curds, the building block of poutine | Fromagerie des Basques (Trois-Pistoles) --- voted Quebec's best |
| **Artisanal cheeses** | Multiple fromageries within 90 minutes | Fromagerie des Basques; Fromagerie Le Mouton Blanc (sheep's milk Tomme du Kamouraska); Fromagerie Le Détour |
| **Kamouraska lamb** | The region produces 32% of all Quebec lamb | Côté Est restaurant; local butchers |

### Restaurant Recommendations

**The Essentials (3-5 sources agree):**

| Restaurant | Location | Cuisine | Price | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Poissonnerie Lauzier / Bistro de la Mer** | Kamouraska | Seafood | $$ | Seasonal bistro at the fish market; lobster guédilles, shrimp poutine, fish soups; ultra-fresh; open-air seating (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Gemini) |
| **L'Estaminet** | 299 Rue Lafontaine, RDL | Pub/bistro | $$ | 25-30 year institution; burgers, varied menu; terrace; $50-80 CAD for two (Perplexity, Claude, ChatGPT) |
| **Au Boucaneux** | 210 Rue Mackay, RDL | Seafood | $$-$$$ | Casual waterfront near the ferry terminal; captain's platter; river view (Claude, ChatGPT, Mistral) |
| **L'Innocent / Café L'Innocent** | 460 Rue Lafontaine, RDL | Fusion/Canadian | $$ | Women-owned; bilingual staff; lamb poutine; excellent vegan options; homemade with local/organic ingredients (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Claude) |

**Strong Mentions (2 sources):**

| Restaurant | Location | Cuisine | Notable |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Côté Est** | 76 Avenue Morel, Kamouraska | Michelin Bib Gourmand | Heritage presbytery with terrace; guinea fowl terrine, Tomme du Kamouraska grilled cheese; $80-130 CAD for two; reservations recommended (Claude, ChatGPT) |
| **Grand'Ourse --- La Cantine de Kamouraska** | Kamouraska | Gourmet casse-croûte | Counter service; sturgeon burgers, lobster guédilles, duck confit poutine; $30-50 for two (Claude, ChatGPT) |
| **Cantine Côtière** | Saint-Fabien (near Bic) | St. Lawrence cuisine | Winner of "Best Cantine in Quebec" (2025 Lauriers de la gastronomie); run by Chef Colombe Saint-Pierre; guédille nordique; $30-50 for two (Claude) |
| **Microbrasserie Aux Fous Brassant** | 262 Rue Lafontaine, RDL | Brewpub | 12 locally brewed beers; nachos, charcuterie, fondue; full non-alcoholic menu; $40-65 for two (Claude) |
| **Pizzéria des Battures** | Notre-Dame-du-Portage | Pizza | Former professional snowboarder opened this in the old presbytery; thin crusts, mushroom pizza; dinner Wed-Sun (Perplexity) |
| **Restaurant du Phare** | Rimouski | Seafood | #1-rated seafood restaurant in all of Bas-Saint-Laurent; 4.6 stars, 536 reviews; worth the drive on the Bic or Pointe-au-Père day (Perplexity) |
| **Maqahamok Pub** | Cacouna | Indigenous-owned | Wood-fired pizzas, smoked meats, mocktails; pair with Putep't-awt (Gemini) |

### The Casse-Croûte Culture

All sources agree: **casse-croûtes** (Quebec roadside snack bars) are the soul of casual dining in this region. Neon-lit shacks or counter-service windows with picnic tables. Poutine, guédilles, hot dogs steamés, soft-serve ice cream. $15-35 CAD for two. Zero dress code. Zero social pressure. Perfect for the couple's preferences.

**RDL's casse-croûte anchors:** Casse-Croûte Mini-Putt (60 Rue Fraser) --- multiple reviewers call it the best poutine in Quebec. Snack Bar D'Amours (Rue Fraser) --- the local classic. Casse-Croûte Frais Délices (Gemini's first-night pick).

> **My take:** Poissonnerie Lauzier in Kamouraska is your first food priority --- get the smoked eel and a guédille au homard. L'Innocent for lunch in RDL on the settle-in day. Au Boucaneux near the ferry for sunset-adjacent waterfront seafood. Cantine Côtière near Bic is the lunch anchor on the park day --- Claude's find of the "Best Cantine in Quebec" winner. Côté Est in Kamouraska is the one nicer meal if you want it. And cycle through the casse-croûtes for easy evenings --- they're the best no-stress dining in Quebec.

---

## Practical Consensus

### Park Passes

- **SEPAQ** (Quebec national parks): Bic, Lac-Témiscouata. Day-use fee ~$10 CAD/person. Purchase online at sepaq.com in advance for Bic (the park limits daily visitors)
- **Parks Canada**: Cap-de-Bon-Désir and other marine park sites if visited. Canada Strong Pass offers free admission June 19-September 7, 2026 (Claude notes this)
- No online-only booking nightmare like Ontario Parks. SEPAQ parks accept gate purchases but online purchase is recommended for Bic to guarantee entry

### Fuel

Gas stations are well-distributed along Route 132 and A-20 (every 15-30 km through populated areas). **Fill up before departing RDL for rural exploration.** Île Verte has no gas station. Critical on the return: fill in Saint-Georges de Beauce before the remote Armstrong/Jackman border crossing (Claude); fill in Jackman before US-201 (next gas 60 miles south in Bingham). Quebec gas averages ~$1.60-1.70 CAD/liter (~$3.30-3.50 USD/gallon).

### Cell Coverage

Good in RDL and all populated areas along Route 132 and A-20. **Dead spots:** Île Verte, isolated stretches of Route 185/A-85, and the US-201 corridor between Jackman and Skowhegan (Claude). Download offline Google Maps for the region before the trip.

### Border Crossing

| Requirement | Status (2025-2026) |
|---|---|
| Passport | Valid US passport book required (NH does not issue Enhanced Driver's Licenses) |
| ArriveCAN | Not required since October 2022 |
| COVID vaccination | Not required since October 2022 |
| Visa | Not required for stays under 180 days |
| Criminal record | Any conviction including DUI/DWI may result in denial of entry |
| Auto insurance | Proof required |
| Prohibited items | Undeclared firearms (most handguns prohibited), pepper spray, cannabis (illegal to transport across borders) |

**Outbound crossing: Derby Line, VT / Stanstead, QC** (I-91 terminus). Open 24/7. Monday morning should move quickly (10-30 minutes).

**Return crossing (Claude's route): Armstrong, QC / Jackman, ME.** Remote crossing with virtually no wait times.

**Duty-free:** $800 USD exemption on return after 48+ hours abroad, plus 1 liter of alcohol per person.

### Cell Phone Roaming

T-Mobile (most plans) and AT&T (all unlimited plans) include Canada at no extra charge. Verizon TravelPass ~$5-10/day. Coverage along A-20 and in towns is reliable; rural secondary roads and islands have dead zones.

### Currency

~1 USD = 1.36 CAD (~1 CAD = $0.73 USD). Credit and debit cards with contactless tap work virtually everywhere --- Canada is more cashless than the US. Carry $150-200 CAD cash for market vendors, Île Verte ferry, small farm stands, and casse-croûtes.

### Tides

Bookmark **tides.gc.ca** and search Station 03130 (Rivière-du-Loup). Semi-diurnal pattern: two highs and two lows daily, shifting ~50 minutes later each day. The visual difference between high and low tide is dramatic --- hundreds of metres of exposed mudflat. Plan photography and seal-viewing around low tides; plan ferry connections around higher water.

### Road Driving

Speed limits in km/h: 100 km/h (62 mph) on autoroutes, 90 km/h (56 mph) on rural highways, 50 km/h (31 mph) in towns. **Radar detectors are illegal in Quebec** and will be confiscated with a fine. Check quebec511.info for real-time construction and conditions.

### Budget Estimate

| Item | Estimated Cost (CAD) | USD Equivalent (~0.73) |
|---|---|---|
| Hôtel Levesque, 7 nights @ ~$215/night | $1,505 | ~$1,100 |
| Jackman ME overnight (if Claude's return route) | $120 USD | $120 |
| SEPAQ park passes (Bic + Témiscouata, ~$10/person x 2) | $40 | ~$29 |
| Putep't-awt + shuttle (2 x $25) | $50 | ~$37 |
| Charlevoix ferry round trip (car + 2 adults) | $205 | ~$150 |
| Pointe-au-Père admission (2 x $27.50) | $55 | ~$40 |
| Museum admissions (Bas-Saint-Laurent, Manoir Fraser, etc.) | $40-60 | ~$30-44 |
| Fuel (~2,000 km total) | $250 | ~$183 |
| Dining (2 meals/day out, 9 days) | $900-1,200 | ~$660-875 |
| **Total** | **~$3,165-3,485** | **~$2,350-2,580** |

## Source Quality Assessment

**Perplexity Deep Research** --- The most thorough and best-cited response. 76 references. Strongest practical details: specific addresses, trail surfaces, restaurant pricing, ferry schedule PDFs, tide station numbers. The day-by-day itinerary is the most actionable single-source plan. Uniquely surfaces the Jardins de Métis/Reford Gardens, Pizzéria des Battures, and the Canada Day crowd dynamics. The photography section includes specific lens recommendations and timing. The critical AML whale cruise cancellation disclosure is essential and missed by Mistral. Weakness: the Route 132 scenic coverage is less evocative than Claude's; the return routing through Edmundston/I-95 is functional but not scenic.

**Claude.ai** --- The most structurally differentiated and analytically sophisticated response. Three unique contributions of high value: (1) the Beauce/Old Canada Road return route through Jackman, ME, producing zero overlap with the outbound and adding a designated National Scenic Byway; (2) the tidal photography planning section with moon phase analysis and specific timing advice; (3) the L'Isle-Verte salt marshes as a tidal-pattern photography location (the single most original subject recommendation across all five sources). The hotel analysis is the deepest, with specific amenity comparisons, WiFi infrastructure reasoning, and a third option (Quality Inn with kitchenettes). The restaurant section surfaces Cantine Côtière (Best Cantine in Quebec winner), Côté Est (Michelin Bib Gourmand), and the Fromagerie des Basques. The photography gear list is the most comprehensive with a super-telephoto recommendation and binoculars. Weakness: the two-day return adds logistical complexity and sacrifices one destination night; the overall tone is more "reference manual" than "travel narrative."

**ChatGPT Deep Research** --- The most detailed single-day itinerary with specific addresses, hours, and pricing for every recommendation. The Kamouraska food scene coverage is the deepest across all sources --- Boulangerie Niemand, La Fée Gourmande, Poissonnerie Lauzier, and Le Comptoir Gourmand are all named with specific street locations. The Putep't-awt description is the most thorough, including shuttle logistics, cost tiers, and booking advice. The Charlevoix ferry day logistics section is the most actionable (specific departure times, cost breakdowns, contingency planning). Uniquely surfaces the Route 230 inland return loop through Saint-Pascal as a different perspective on Kamouraska. The Île Verte day-trip alternative is well-researched with the ferry phone number and practical caveats. Weakness: the outbound route adds an I-89 segment that doesn't obviously improve on the standard I-93/I-91 routing. The return through Edmundston is the same as Perplexity's --- competent but not distinctive.

**Gemini Deep Think** --- The most strategic and contrarian response. Three unique contributions: (1) the Canada Day inland escape to Lac-Témiscouata --- the single most actionable crowd-avoidance strategy; (2) the Parc des Chutes upper parking lot hack ("do NOT park at the bottom and climb the 800-step gorge trail --- drive to the upper lot, 5-minute flat walk to the footbridge over the falls"); (3) the Maqahamok Pub recommendation (Indigenous-owned restaurant near Putep't-awt). The B&B warning is the most blunt and useful. The hotel recommendation includes the "odd-numbered river-view room" hack for Hôtel Levesque. The "zero humidity" assessment is the most reassuring weather framing. Weakness: lighter on specific addresses and pricing than Perplexity or ChatGPT; no unique return-route contribution; the itinerary covers fewer attractions overall.

**Mistral Le Chat** --- The weakest response by a significant margin. Contains multiple factual errors: recommends Croisières AML whale cruises (not operating in 2026), suggests a day trip to Tadoussac (200 km each way, unrealistic), and proposes a "121 km Charlevoix mountain drive loop" through Hautes-Gorges and Grands-Jardins (geographically implausible from the south shore without a ferry crossing). The recommendation to split the 6.5-hour drive over two days with Quebec City overnights is overly cautious and compresses destination time to 5 nights. Leads with Auberge de la Pointe rather than the consensus Hôtel Levesque. The day-by-day itinerary is generic and includes suggestions (whale watching from boats, mountain hiking in Charlevoix parks) that either don't exist in 2026 or don't match the couple's stated preferences. The one unique contribution --- Hôtel Universel as a lodging option --- is better covered by Claude.

## Recommended Itinerary Skeleton

Based on consensus with Claude's return routing, ChatGPT's specific detail, and Gemini's crowd-avoidance strategies:

**Day 1 --- Sunday, June 29: Outbound through Vermont.** Hooksett via I-93/I-91 to Derby Line border crossing. Through Vermont's Northeast Kingdom. Into Quebec via A-55/A-20. Exit at Montmagny for Route 132 scenic finale through Saint-Jean-Port-Joli and Kamouraska. Arrive Hôtel Levesque by late afternoon. Evening: First sunset at Parc de la Pointe. Dinner: Au Boucaneux near the ferry terminal.

**Day 2 --- Monday, June 30: Orientation + Sunset Scouting.** Morning: Parc des Chutes waterfall (use upper parking lot; morning light on falls). Walk Parc de la Pointe as a location scout --- identify 2-3 sunset compositions. Lunch: L'Innocent (460 Rue Lafontaine). Afternoon: Musée du Bas-Saint-Laurent or free time at hotel. Evening: Drive to Notre-Dame-du-Portage for sunset at the wharf. Dinner: Pizzéria des Battures if staying for sunset in Notre-Dame-du-Portage.

**Day 3 --- Tuesday, July 1 (Canada Day): Inland Escape to Témiscouata.** Gemini's strategy: flee the coast on Canada Day. Drive south to Lac-Témiscouata (50 min). Morning: Fort Ingall (bilingual, flat, costumed guides). Afternoon: Parc national du Lac-Témiscouata --- boardwalks on the lake, boreal forest, archaeological interpretation. Optional: Domaine Acer for maple wine tasting. Return to RDL for sunset at Parc de la Pointe.

**Day 4 --- Wednesday, July 2: Kamouraska + Route 132 West.** Dawn: drive to Kamouraska Quay for sunrise photography (arrive by 5:30 AM). Morning: walk Avenue Morel --- Boulangerie Niemand for bread, Poissonnerie Lauzier for smoked eel. Lunch: Bistro de la Mer (lobster guédilles) or Côté Est for the Bib Gourmand experience. Afternoon: return via Route 230 inland loop through Saint-Pascal for a different landscape perspective. Evening: sunset at Kamouraska or return to Parc de la Pointe.

**Day 5 --- Thursday, July 3: Putep't-awt + Cacouna (Indigenous Heritage Day).** Morning: Putep't-awt beluga observatory with electric shuttle (book in advance; go early when belugas are most active). 2-3 hours including trail and observatory. Lunch: Maqahamok Pub (Indigenous-owned, Cacouna). Afternoon: Parc côtier Kiskotuk --- free coastal trails with Indigenous interpretation. Or return to hotel for pool/spa. Evening: sunset from Hôtel Levesque terrace or Parc de la Pointe.

**Day 6 --- Friday, July 4: Parc national du Bic.** Full-day commitment. Check tides.gc.ca for low tide timing and plan accordingly. Arrive by 7:30-8:00 AM. Morning: Chemin-du-Nord trail for coastal coves and wildlife. Time Pointe aux Épinettes seal observation for low tide. Lunch: Exit park for Cantine Côtière in Saint-Fabien (Best Cantine in Quebec). Afternoon: additional trails or drive the park road slowly; if energy permits, continue to Rimouski for Restaurant du Phare (top-rated seafood in the region). Or sunset from Bic (marked sunset spots on the park map).

**Day 7 --- Saturday, July 5: Charlevoix Ferry Day.** Arrive at RDL ferry wharf by 6:15 AM for first departure (~7:45 AM). 65-minute crossing with whale-watching potential. Drive Route 138 west to La Malbaie, then Route 362 (Route du Fleuve) through Les Éboulements toward Baie-Saint-Paul. Lunch in Baie-Saint-Paul. Return ferry mid-to-late afternoon. Evening: final sunset session at Parc de la Pointe.

**Day 8 --- Sunday, July 6: Departure via Beauce/Old Canada Road.** Optional dawn: check the RDL wharf for belugas one last time, or sunrise at L'Isle-Verte salt marshes. Depart mid-morning. A-20 west to Lévis (stop at Terrasse de Lévis for the iconic view of Old Quebec City). A-73 south through Beauce maple country. Fill tank in Saint-Georges. Route 173 to Armstrong/Jackman border. Overnight in Jackman, ME.

Optional: Moxie Falls detour (90-foot waterfall, 1-mile walk). Wyman Lake photos. Fuel in Bingham. I-95 south to Hooksett. Arrive early-to-mid afternoon.

*Alternative Day 3 (if Canada Day crowds are not a concern):* **Pointe-au-Père Maritime Site.** Drive east to Rimouski/Pointe-au-Père for the Empress of Ireland Museum, Onondaga submarine, and lighthouse. This is the strongest rainy-day option and can be swapped with any other day. Continue to Jardins de Métis/Reford Gardens if ambitious (adds 40 min east).

*Alternative return (no Jackman overnight):* **Edmundston/I-95 corridor.** A-85 south to Edmundston, NB. Route 2 south to Houlton, ME. I-95 south through Bangor to Hooksett. ~8-8.5 hours, single day, different terrain from outbound.
