# Quebec City, QC --- Consensus Research Report

Five LLM research responses synthesized: Perplexity (Deep Research), Claude.ai, ChatGPT (Deep Research), Gemini (Deep Think), and Mistral (Le Chat).

---

## Executive Summary

All five sources converge on a clear verdict: Quebec City in early July is a world-class destination for this couple, delivering a UNESCO-listed walled city that photographs like a European capital, a constellation of scenic day trips within an hour's radius, and a calendar window that narrowly dodges every major crowd event. The consensus is strong on timing, format, and strategy. There are no fatal flaws.

The trip's architecture exploits a fundamental insight that all five sources independently discover: **Quebec City's best experiences happen at its edges, not its centre.** The walled city is magnificent but physically small (~1.15 km²) and densely visited from 9 AM to 9 PM. The real magic lives on Île d'Orléans' strawberry fields in morning light, on Route 362 where the Laurentian Mountains plunge into the St. Lawrence, in Wendake's longhouses, and at the base of Montmorency Falls with a tripod and ND filter at 6:30 AM. These are all within an hour of the hotel and virtually crowd-free on weekday mornings. Old Quebec deserves the dawn patrol --- one or two sunrise sessions to capture empty cobblestones in golden light --- and then the couple should leave before the tour buses arrive.

The calendar alignment is genuinely fortunate. The Festival d'été de Québec (FEQ) --- one of North America's largest music festivals, 100,000+ capacity --- begins July 9, three days after departure. The Construction Holiday (Quebec's busiest tourism period) starts around July 19. Claude uniquely identifies that **zero cruise ships dock between June 29 and July 6**, eliminating the 2,000+ passenger surges that typically flood Lower Town by 9 AM. Canada Day (July 1) is the one crowd spike, compounded by Quebec's traditional "Moving Day" (mass lease turnover), but every source builds an escape plan around it.

Where sources diverge is on lodging philosophy, routing ambition, and day-trip priorities. Hotel PUR (Marriott Tribute Portfolio) is the plurality pick at 3/5 sources, but Claude's Hôtel Palace Royal offers suite-style kitchens, and Gemini's radical call --- basing at the Hôtel-Musée Premières Nations in Wendake itself --- is the most architecturally distinctive recommendation across all five responses. On routing, Claude delivers the most scenic outbound through Vermont's Northeast Kingdom and Lake Willoughby, while Perplexity and ChatGPT default to the faster I-93/I-91 corridor. For day trips, Charlevoix's Route 362 earns universal praise as one of North America's great scenic drives, but Mistral is the outlier, skipping it entirely in favour of La Mauricie and Plaisance --- parks that are 2+ hours away and deliver less per hour invested than closer options.

**The Old Quebec anchoring bias** surfaces across all five sources. Every response devotes its most detailed, emotionally charged section to the walled city --- the Château Frontenac, Terrasse Dufferin, Petit-Champlain, Place Royale. This is natural; these are globally iconic images. But the structural reality for a crowd-averse couple is different: Old Quebec can be photographically exhausted in one sunrise session. The real discoveries --- the ones that will define this trip in memory --- are the Charlevoix coast, the Île d'Orléans farm loop, the Wendake cultural immersion, and the accessible waterfalls and glacial valleys within 30 minutes of the hotel. Old Quebec absolutely deserves the dawn patrol, but the itinerary should be weighted toward the day trips that reveal the region's genuine depth.

## Trip Format

| Source | Format | Nights at Destination | Travel Days | Outbound Route | Return Route |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Perplexity | Single day each way | 7 nights | 2 travel days | I-93 N / I-91 N / A-55 / A-20 via Stanstead border | A-73 S / Route 173 S / US-201 (Old Canada Road) via Jackman |
| Claude.ai | Scenic single day each way | 7 nights | 2 travel days | Vermont NEK via Route 5A (Lake Willoughby) to Stanstead | Route 173 through Beauce / US-201 / Route 2 via Crawford Notch |
| ChatGPT | Single day each way | 7 nights | 2 travel days | I-93 / I-91 / A-55 to Quebec City | Chemin du Roy partial + faster roads |
| Gemini DT | Single day each way | 7 nights | 2 travel days | I-93 / US-3 "Moose Alley" to Chartierville | VT Route 5A (Lake Willoughby) / I-91 S |
| Mistral | Overnight split each way | 5 nights | 4 travel days | I-93 / I-91 via Sherbrooke overnight | Route 173 / US-201 via overnight stop |

**Consensus: 4-1 in favour of single-day drives each way.** The distance is ~330-350 miles / 530-560 km / 5.5-7 hours. Four of five sources agree this is a comfortable single-day drive giving 7 full nights at destination. Mistral is the structural outlier, recommending an overnight split that burns two extra days on transit and reduces destination time to 5 nights --- an unnecessary trade-off for a couple that regularly considers 7-8 hour drive days (see Moncton research at ~450 miles).

**Route divergence is where it gets interesting.** Three sources default to the I-93/I-91/A-55 corridor through Vermont --- the fastest, most predictable option with the Stanstead border crossing. Claude is the scenic outlier on the outbound: Vermont's Northeast Kingdom via Route 5A along Lake Willoughby (a glacial lake flanked by cliffs that locals call "the Lucerne of Vermont"), with stops at the Dog Chapel hilltop panorama and the Haskell Free Library that straddles the US-Canada border. Gemini takes an entirely different approach --- US-3 "Moose Alley" through Pittsburg, NH, crossing at the rural Chartierville border post (open 8 AM-8 PM only).

**The return route consensus favours the Old Canada Road.** Three of five sources recommend US-201 (Old Canada Road Scenic Byway) through Maine --- 78 miles of forested wilderness along the Kennebec River, with Wyman Lake reflections, the Attean Overlook, and the remote settlement of The Forks. Claude adds the most distinctive return enhancement: the Beauce region (Route 173) through Quebec's maple-syrup heartland, with a stop at the Pont Perrault covered bridge near Notre-Dame-des-Pins (154 metres, the longest covered bridge in Quebec), then Crawford Notch in the White Mountains for a different landscape from the outbound Franconia Notch.

**The Stanstead vs. Chartierville border question:** Three sources recommend the Stanstead/Derby Line crossing on I-91 (larger, faster, predictable). Claude also uses Stanstead. Gemini recommends Chartierville (smaller, rural, open 8 AM-8 PM only). For the return, three sources recommend the Jackman/Armstrong crossing into Maine (24 hours, ~500 vehicles/day, minimal wait). Both inbound crossings work. For a Monday morning arrival, Stanstead is the safer bet; Chartierville adds character but schedule risk.

> **My take:** The I-93/I-91/Stanstead corridor outbound is the safe default --- it works, it's fast, and it preserves energy for the first evening exploration. But Claude's Lake Willoughby detour is the one scenic enhancement worth the extra 45-60 minutes --- the glacial lake genuinely photographs like a Norwegian fjord, and the Haskell Free Library (a building that straddles the international border, with tape lines on the floor marking the line) is a 15-minute stop that makes a memorable story. For the return, the Old Canada Road is the unambiguous answer --- it's a National Scenic Byway, it's completely different scenery from the outbound, and the Attean Overlook just south of Jackman is one of Maine's most photographed viewpoints. Skip Mistral's overnight split entirely; this couple does not need two extra transit days for a 5.5-hour drive.

## Lodging

### Primary Recommendation

**Hotel PUR Quebec, a Tribute Portfolio Hotel (395 Rue de la Couronne)** --- recommended by Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Mistral as a primary or strong option.

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| Address | 395 Rue de la Couronne, Quebec City |
| Rate | ~$105-130 USD/night (~$145-175 CAD) |
| Internet | Free high-speed WiFi throughout; wired unavailable |
| Gym | Fitness centre; open 24/7 with Life Fitness machines, ellipticals, bikes, treadmill, free weights |
| Pool | Indoor heated pool |
| Sauna | Yes |
| Room | Modern rooms with refrigerator, coffee/tea maker; no kitchenette |
| Breakfast | No communal breakfast. On-site restaurant TABLE (paid). No forced social interaction |
| Parking | On-site available |
| Location | Saint-Roch district --- Quebec's creative/tech neighbourhood. 15-minute walk to Old Quebec. Away from thickest tourist crush |
| Rating | 8.8/10 on Expedia |

**Why it wins (3/5 sources agree):** The Saint-Roch location is the key strategic advantage --- close enough to walk to Old Quebec for dawn photography (15 minutes), far enough to avoid the noise, parking chaos, and shoulder-to-shoulder tourist density of the walled city. The 24/7 gym with proper equipment (not two dumbbells and a broken treadmill) supports the daily routine. No communal breakfast eliminates the forced social interaction. The Marriott Tribute Portfolio affiliation provides loyalty program integration without the anonymity of a chain property.

### Runner-Up: Hôtel Palace Royal

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| Address | 775 Avenue Honoré-Mercier |
| Rate | ~$145-180 USD/night (~$200-250 CAD) |
| Internet | WiFi + wired Ethernet available on request |
| Gym | Fitness centre |
| Pool | Indoor pool |
| Hot tub | Yes |
| Sauna | Yes |
| Room | Suite-style with separate living area, refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker |
| Breakfast | No communal breakfast |
| Location | Adjacent to Convention Centre and Plains of Abraham. 10-minute walk to Old Quebec gates |
| Parking | Indoor, ~$25 CAD/day |

**Claude's primary pick.** The suite-style rooms with separate living area and kitchenette are the killer differentiator --- for a week-long working vacation, having a real workspace separate from the bedroom and the ability to make coffee at 5 AM before a dawn departure is a genuine quality-of-life upgrade. The wired Ethernet is a critical backup for reliable remote work (Claude flags hotel WiFi as unreliable under peak occupancy). The location is slightly closer to Old Quebec than Hotel PUR and directly adjacent to the Plains of Abraham for morning walks.

### The Bold Outlier: Hôtel-Musée Premières Nations (Wendake)

| Attribute | Details |
|---|---|
| Address | 5 Place de la Rencontre, Wendake |
| Rate | ~$250-350 USD/night |
| Internet | Corporate-grade WiFi |
| Gym | Modern fitness centre |
| Pool | Indoor pool |
| Room | Boutique resort designed to resemble a traditional Iroquoian longhouse |
| Breakfast | No communal breakfast. Restaurant La Traite on-site |
| Location | Wendake, 20 minutes from downtown. Huron-Wendat Museum physically attached |
| Parking | Free |

**Gemini's most architecturally distinctive recommendation.** Basing in Wendake rather than downtown Quebec City is a genuine strategic insight: immediate highway access for day trips without downtown traffic, zero tourist density, and the Huron-Wendat Museum literally attached to the hotel. The Kabir Kouba Falls are a 5-minute flat walk from the back door. The trade-off is real: 20 minutes to Old Quebec instead of 10-15, and the highest nightly rate of any option. But for a couple whose priorities are privacy, Indigenous heritage, and escape from tourist density, this is the property that most precisely matches their stated preferences.

### Other Mentions

| Hotel | Source | Key Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Quebec City Marriott Downtown** | ChatGPT, Perplexity (alt) | Better location for Old Quebec walking; 24/7 gym; 9.0 rating; no pool; WiFi free for Bonvoy members only |
| **Hilton Québec** | ChatGPT | Heated rooftop pool; proximity to historic district; corporate-grade operations |
| **Home2 Suites by Hilton** | ChatGPT, Gemini DT (backup) | Free parking; gym; pool; car-oriented location; in-room kitchen; ~$160-190 USD/night |
| **Alt Hotel Quebec** | Claude (backup) | Sainte-Foy location; explicitly advertises "full bandwidth" WiFi; 24-hour gym; no pool |
| **Hôtel & Suites Le Dauphin** | Claude (backup) | Lebourgneuf; free parking + free breakfast + free shuttle to Old Quebec; pool + gym; ~$85-105 USD/night. Best total value |
| **Hôtel Manoir Victoria** | Mistral | Old Quebec location; indoor pool, gym, spa; ~$200-300 USD/night |

### Why B&Bs and Historic Inns Don't Work

Same logic as every other destination for this couple: no B&B energy, no chatty hosts, no forced communal breakfasts, no spotty WiFi in stone buildings. Gemini delivers the sharpest version of this argument: historic stone buildings in Old Quebec often have terrible WiFi, cramped quarters, zero parking, and "the dreaded communal breakfast chat." All five sources recommend only hotels.

> **My take:** Hotel PUR is the default answer for most travellers --- good gym, good location, good price, no drama. But for a week-long working vacation, I'd seriously consider the Palace Royal for the suite layout and wired Ethernet, or Gemini's Wendake base for the privacy, free parking, and cultural immersion. The Palace Royal's separate living area means one person can work while the other sleeps, and the kitchen means 5 AM coffee without leaving the room. The Wendake option is the bolder call but the one most likely to surprise --- waking up on the Akiawenrahk River, walking to the Huron-Wendat Museum before breakfast, and driving 20 minutes to Old Quebec for a dawn shoot is an entirely different trip from waking up in a downtown hotel room. If budget is a concern, Le Dauphin's free parking + free breakfast + free shuttle saves $500+ over the week compared to the downtown options.

---

## The Signature Experience: Empty Cobblestones at Sunrise

All five sources converge on a single operational truth: **Old Quebec at 5:00 AM is a completely different city from Old Quebec at 11:00 AM.** With sunrise at approximately 5:07-5:19 AM during the trip dates, the golden light hitting 400-year-old stone buildings on entirely empty cobblestone streets is the trip's defining photographic opportunity. Every source builds its itinerary around this dawn window.

### Why the Dawn Patrol Matters Operationally

The walled city is the only fortified city in North America north of Mexico. The built environment is genuinely world-class --- Château Frontenac, the Terrasse Dufferin boardwalk, the Petit-Champlain quarter (Canada's oldest commercial street), Place Royale (birthplace of French civilization in North America), and the Fresque des Québécois trompe-l'oeil mural. But the same UNESCO designation that makes it visually extraordinary also makes it a tourist magnet. By 9:30 AM, cruise ship passengers (when ships are docked) and tour groups fill the narrow streets. The dawn patrol is not optional --- it is the only way this couple will experience Old Quebec as it deserves to be experienced.

### The Dawn Photography Sequence (All 5 Sources Agree)

| Stop | Key Subject | Light Direction | Lens | Access Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Pierre-Dugua-de-Mons Terrace** | Château Frontenac with copper roofs lit gold by northeast sunrise | Direct morning light on façade | Wide-angle | Flat grass terrace, empty at 5 AM |
| **Terrasse Dufferin** | Iconic boardwalk below Château Frontenac, St. Lawrence River below | Morning light warms stone with rich shadow | Wide-angle + telephoto | Flat, fully paved, zero accessibility issues |
| **Petit-Champlain / Rue du Petit-Champlain** | Narrow cobblestone lanes, colourful facades, Umbrella Alley | East-facing facades catch morning light | Mid-range zoom | Cobblestone, sloped; shops don't open until 9:30-10:00 AM |
| **Place Royale** | Fresque des Québécois mural, Notre-Dame-des-Victoires church | Southeast-facing mural catches good morning light | Wide-angle (small square) | Flat cobblestone |
| **Parc Montmorency** | Crowd-free angle on Château Frontenac without tourists in background | Any time | Telephoto | Flat park, benches, easy access |

**Getting down to Lower Town without the stairs:** Claude identifies the critical access hack --- park in the Dalhousie underground lot in Lower Town and walk to Place Royale and Petit-Champlain at street level, avoiding the steep Breakneck Stairs (Escalier Casse-Cou, 59 steps) entirely. The funicular (cable car between Upper and Lower Town) opens at 7:30 AM.

> **My take:** Schedule exactly two dawn sessions --- Day 2 (the first full day, when you're freshest and most excited) and one more later in the week as a makeup or different-light session. Park in the Dalhousie lot, start at Place Royale and Petit-Champlain in Lower Town, then walk up to Terrasse Dufferin as the light climbs. Be back at the hotel by 8:30 AM for breakfast. You will have captured the best of Old Quebec in 3 hours, and you never need to fight the midday crowds. The rest of the week belongs to the day trips.

| **Artillery Park NHS** | Claude | Lesser-visited military fortification with excellent exhibits, rarely crowded |
| **Le Grand Marché de Québec** | Claude, ChatGPT | Quebec City's premier food market. Local produce, artisan cheeses, maple products. Daily hours. Near ExpoCité area (relocated from Old Port) |
| **National Assembly of Québec** | ChatGPT | Free guided tours, ~60 minutes. Accessible |
| **La Mauricie NP** | Mistral | 2 hours west. Lakes, rivers, flat trails. Beautiful but poor time investment given Jacques-Cartier is 30 minutes away |

### Skip (consensus)

**Plaisance NP (Mistral):** Only Mistral recommends this. It is well over an hour from Quebec City and delivers marshland/river views available much closer at Cap Tourmente or Kouchibouguac-style alternatives. Not worth the drive.

**La Mauricie NP (Mistral):** Same issue. Two hours west of Quebec City for lakes and forest that Jacques-Cartier delivers in 30 minutes. Save it for a future trip with a different base.

**Aquarium du Québec (ChatGPT):** Mentioned as a rainy-day option. It's a decent fallback but not worth prime weather hours.

> **My take:** The Tier 1 experiences are stacked. This couple could spend 7 days doing nothing but Old Quebec at dawn, Île d'Orléans, Charlevoix, Wendake, Montmorency Falls, and Jacques-Cartier and have a genuinely outstanding trip. The Tier 2 additions that most enhance the trip are the Lévis ferry at sunset (the defining skyline photograph) and the Observatoire (the best orientation experience). The Basilique Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré is a genuine wow --- the interior is on par with European cathedrals --- but it's 30 km out of the way and should be combined with Montmorency Falls or the Charlevoix drive. Canyon Sainte-Anne, if combined with the Basilica and Mont-Sainte-Anne gondola on a single Côte-de-Beaupré day (as Claude designs), makes an outstanding "waterfall and vertigo" day. Skip La Mauricie and Plaisance entirely.

## Indigenous Heritage

### The Anchor: Wendake

**Wendake** is the primary Indigenous heritage destination for this trip --- a living Huron-Wendat Nation community of roughly 2,000 people, 15-20 minutes from downtown Quebec City. All five sources recommend it. Unlike museum-only experiences, Wendake is a self-governing First Nations community where heritage sites exist within a living, breathing neighbourhood.

The experience design is layered:

1. **Huron-Wendat Museum** (indoor, accessible, 1-1.5 hours): The intellectual foundation. 2,000+ objects, the new "Wendat Endi'" exhibition, Ekionkiestha' National Longhouse with storytelling by the hearth
2. **Onhoüa Chetek8e Traditional Huron Site** (outdoor, guided, 1-1.5 hours): The tactile follow-up. Reconstructed village with longhouse, smoking huts, sweat lodge. Guides in traditional dress explain tools, lifestyle, myths, spiritual practices
3. **Restaurant La Traite or La Sagamité** (lunch): The culinary dimension. Indigenous terroir cuisine --- venison, bison, boreal herbs, sagamité corn soup, bannock. Not tourist kitsch; La Traite is one of the most respected restaurants in the region
4. **Onhwa' Lumina** (evening, 1.2 km walk, ~1 hour): The emotional crescendo. Night walk through the forest with Moment Factory light/sound/video projections celebrating Huron-Wendat creation myths. **Operates during the trip dates (June 26-July 23, 2026)**

### Additional Indigenous Context

| Site | Source | Key Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Musée de la civilisation** | Perplexity, Claude, ChatGPT, Mistral | "This Is Our Story" permanent exhibition developed with all 11 First Nations and Inuit peoples of Quebec. The essential indoor complement |
| **MNBAQ "Illipunga" exhibition** | Claude | 100+ works of Inuit art from the Brousseau Collection. Only open in Pierre Lassonde Pavilion during 2026 construction |
| **Kabir Kouba Falls** | Claude, Gemini DT | Waterfall on the Saint-Charles River in Wendake itself. 5-minute flat walk from Hôtel-Musée. 18th-century mill ruins |

> **My take:** Wendake is the cultural experience most likely to surprise this couple. The combination of a nationally significant museum, a living Indigenous community, world-class Indigenous cuisine, and a Moment Factory night walk --- all within 20 minutes of downtown --- is genuinely rare. Schedule it on Canada Day (July 1) when everything downtown is crowded. Commit to the full arc: museum morning, La Sagamité or La Traite for lunch, traditional site afternoon, Onhwa' Lumina at 9:00 PM. This is a day that will redefine the trip.

---

## July Conditions --- All Sources Agree

| Factor | Consensus |
|---|---|
| Temperature | Highs 24-26°C (75-79°F); lows 13-16°C (55-61°F); humidex adds 5-7°C of perceived heat |
| Humidity | 63-83% range; mornings are most humid but also coolest --- perfect for this couple's preferences |
| Rain | ~12-15 days with some precipitation in July; typically afternoon thunderstorms, not all-day soakers. ~9 hours sunshine per day |
| Sunrise/Sunset | ~5:07-5:19 AM / ~8:25-8:53 PM ADT (~15 hours daylight). Civil twilight begins ~4:25-4:55 AM |
| Fog | Less of a factor than Bay of Fundy destinations. Occasional morning river mist burns off by mid-morning |
| Crowds | Early July is busy but pre-peak. The real crush comes mid-to-late July (Construction Holiday + FEQ). Canada Day (July 1) is the spike |
| Bugs | Mosquitoes active at dawn/dusk, especially inland near marshes (Cap Tourmente) and lakes (Jacques-Cartier). Black flies essentially done by early July. Bring DEET or Thermacell |

### Calendar Intelligence

**The Festival d'été de Québec (FEQ):** July 9-19, 2026. 100,000+ capacity main stage on the Plains of Abraham. **The couple leaves July 6, three days before it starts.** This is ideal. However, Claude uniquely warns that stage construction typically begins a week or more in advance --- expect fencing, equipment, and partial closures on the Plains of Abraham by July 4-5.

**The Construction Holiday:** Quebec's busiest tourism period --- the last two weeks of July, when roughly 25% of the province's workforce vacations simultaneously. **The couple is completely before this.**

**Cruise ships:** Claude uniquely identifies that **zero cruise ships dock in Quebec City between June 29 and July 6, 2026.** The last departure is June 27, the next arrival July 9. This eliminates the 2,000+ passenger surges that typically flood Lower Town by 9 AM. This is a significant operational advantage for dawn photography and Lower Town exploration.

**Moving Day (July 1):** Quebec's traditional lease turnover date. Roughly 250,000 households across the province change addresses on July 1. Residential neighbourhoods will have moving trucks and curbside furniture. Old Quebec's tourist core isn't affected, but surrounding neighbourhoods (Saint-Roch, Limoilou, Montcalm) will see congestion. The Wendake escape plan avoids all issues.

### Crowd Strategy

**Canada Day (July 1) is the one major crowd spike.** Official celebrations on Dufferin Terrace (11 AM-2 PM) and family activities on the Plains of Abraham (noon-5 PM). All five sources address this:
- Perplexity: Morning Plains of Abraham (free museum admission), then Wendake
- Claude: Wendake all day, including Onhwa' Lumina evening
- ChatGPT: Montmorency Falls early, then flexible
- Gemini DT: Île d'Orléans all day
- Mistral: Île d'Orléans all day

**The Dawn Patrol advantage:** At latitude 46.8°N, sunrise is ~5:07-5:19 AM. That is 4+ hours before parks, museums, and shops open. Use the extreme daylight for photography in prime light while other visitors are sleeping. This is the single most important crowd-avoidance tactic for the entire trip.

**A note on Canada Day in Quebec:** Perplexity and Claude both observe that the holiday is observed but not celebrated with the same fervour as in English Canada. The Fête nationale du Québec (June 24) carries far more cultural weight locally. July 1 is better known as "Moving Day."

### Time Zone

Quebec City is on **Eastern Daylight Time** --- same as New Hampshire. No time-zone adjustment needed.

> **My take:** The timing is genuinely fortunate. Dodging the FEQ, the Construction Holiday, and all cruise ships in one trip window is the kind of luck that shouldn't be wasted. The weather is nearly ideal --- cool mornings for dawn photography, warm-but-not-oppressive days, and massive golden-hour windows at both ends. The rain pattern (afternoon thunderstorms, not all-day) means mornings are reliably clear for photography. If it's raining, pivot to museums: Musée de la civilisation, Huron-Wendat Museum, MNBAQ, Morrin Centre, or the Observatoire --- all work perfectly in rain.

## Photography Guidance --- Consensus

### Signature Subjects

Quebec City delivers three completely different photographic palettes: the fortified city's stone-and-copper architecture, the pastoral island-and-farmland loops, and the dramatic natural features (waterfalls, glacial valleys, coastal mountains).

| Subject | Where | When | Gear |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Old Quebec cobblestone streets** | Petit-Champlain, Place Royale, Rue Sous-le-Cap | Sunrise (5:00-6:30 AM) | Wide-angle + mid-range; tripod for low light; polarizer for window glare |
| **Château Frontenac** | Pierre-Dugua-de-Mons Terrace; Terrasse Dufferin; Parc Montmorency (crowd-free angle) | Sunrise or golden hour | Wide-angle for context; telephoto for copper-roof details |
| **Quebec City skyline from Lévis** | Lévis ferry (mid-river) + Terrasse du Chevalier-de-Lévis | Sunset (~8:50 PM) | Telephoto for compression; wide-angle for full skyline |
| **Montmorency Falls** | Base-level boardwalk; suspension bridge; staircase platforms | Before 10 AM (falls face northeast) | Tripod + 3-6 stop ND filter essential for silky water; polarizer for mist; wide-angle from base; telephoto from across gorge |
| **Île d'Orléans pastoral landscapes** | Entire island loop; Route du Mitan for farmland | All day, golden hours best | Wide-angle for field-and-sky; telephoto for heritage-home porches and agricultural textures; polarizer for lavender fields |
| **Quebec City from Île d'Orléans** | Sainte-Pétronille (western tip of island) | Evening golden hour (faces west toward city) | Telephoto for skyline compression |
| **Route 362 / Charlevoix coast** | Les Éboulements viewpoints; entire Route 362 | Mid-morning to afternoon (road faces southeast) | Telephoto for mountain-layer compression; polarizer essential for river haze |
| **Jacques-Cartier valley** | Visitor centre viewpoints; Les Cascades trail | Early morning (mist) | Wide-angle with foreground interest; telephoto for valley-wall detail |
| **Basilique Sainte-Anne interior** | Inside the basilica | Midday when light enters | Wide-angle (14-24mm) essential; high ISO or fast lens; no flash |
| **Canyon Sainte-Anne** | Suspension bridges and canyon viewpoints | Midday (light penetrates the forested gorge) | Tripod + ND filter for silky waterfall; polarizer for wet rock; wide-angle for leading-line bridge compositions |
| **Covered bridges** | Pont Perrault (return drive via Beauce) | Any clear day | Wide-angle from riverbank for full-length composition |

### The Top 5 Photography Locations, Ranked for Non-Hikers

1. **Old Quebec at sunrise** --- empty cobblestones, golden light on 400-year-old stone, zero tourists. The signature shot of the trip
2. **Montmorency Falls with tripod and ND filter** --- the single most dramatic natural subject near the city. Cable car access eliminates all hiking
3. **Route 362 through Charlevoix** --- the highest photographic density per km, all drive-up pull-offs with mountain-and-river panoramas
4. **Île d'Orléans loop** --- pastoral textures, heritage homes, strawberry fields, river views. The PEI equivalent
5. **Quebec City skyline from Lévis ferry at sunset** --- the defining panoramic shot that captures the entire city in golden light

### Gear (universal agreement)

- **Circular polarizer** --- the single most important accessory. Cuts river glare, saturates foliage, deepens sky. Essential on the Charlevoix drive, the Île d'Orléans loop, and at every waterfall
- **3-6 stop ND filter** --- long-exposure silky water at Montmorency Falls and Canyon Sainte-Anne. This is the creative technique that transforms tourist snapshots into fine-art images
- **Wide-angle (14-24mm or 16-35mm)** --- Old Quebec narrow streets, Petit-Champlain, Place Royale, basilica interiors, canyon bridge compositions, valley panoramas
- **Standard zoom (24-70mm)** --- village compositions, farm-stand details, harbour scenes
- **Telephoto (70-200mm)** --- Quebec City skyline from Lévis, Château Frontenac copper-roof details, Charlevoix mountain-layer compression, architectural ironwork
- **Tripod** --- essential for dawn/blue-hour Old Quebec, Montmorency Falls long exposure, canyon waterfall work. Old Quebec streets are too crowded for tripods after 9 AM
- **Lens cloth** --- Montmorency Falls spray coats the front element constantly. Carry two
- **Bug spray (DEET)** --- standing still with a tripod at dawn near water makes you a mosquito magnet. Consider Thermacell for stationary sessions

> **My take:** The ND filter at Montmorency Falls is the creative opportunity most tourists will miss. While everyone else shoots handheld snapshots of white water, your wife can set up a tripod at the base, attach a 6-stop ND, and shoot 2-4 second exposures that turn the 83-metre cascade into ethereal silk against jagged rock. The polarizer on the Charlevoix drive is equally non-negotiable --- without it, the St. Lawrence is a flat grey glare; with it, the river becomes a deep blue-green canvas layered against mountain ridgelines. And the Lévis ferry at sunset is the one shot that belongs on the wall --- the entire skyline glowing gold from across the river.

## Dining --- Consensus Rankings

### The Regional Essentials

| Specialty | What It Is | Where to Find It |
|---|---|---|
| **Poutine** | Fries, fresh cheese curds, gravy --- Quebec's iconic comfort food. The curds must squeak | Chez Ashton (24+ locations, the local chain); Le Chic Shack (gourmet versions); Chez Mag on Île d'Orléans (lobster poutine) |
| **Tourtière** | Deep-dish meat pie with seasoned ground pork/veal. Every family has a different recipe | La Bûche; Aux Anciens Canadiens; Buffet de l'Antiquaire |
| **Cipaille (sea pie)** | Layered meat pie with multiple meats, pastry layers, and spices. The complex cousin of tourtière | Buffet de l'Antiquaire |
| **Cretons** | Pork spread seasoned with cinnamon and cloves. Spread on toast at breakfast | Buffet de l'Antiquaire; Paillard (breakfast) |
| **Pouding chômeur** | "Poor man's pudding" --- maple cake pudding. Dense, sweet, unapologetically Québécois | La Bûche |
| **Oreilles de crisse** | Deep-fried pork rinds. Translates to "Christ's ears" | La Bûche |
| **Galettes bretonnes** | Buckwheat savoury crêpes --- Breton tradition transplanted to Quebec | Le Billig |
| **Indigenous terroir** | Venison, bison, elk, sagamité corn soup, bannock, boreal herbs, wild berries | La Traite (Wendake); La Sagamité (Wendake) |
| **Maple everything** | Syrup, butter, candy, fleur de sel au sirop d'érable. Quebec produces 70%+ of the world's supply | Le Grand Marché de Québec; Île d'Orléans farm stands; La Bûche |
| **Fresh curds** | Cheese curds so fresh they squeak against your teeth. Eaten plain from the bag | Laiterie Charlevoix (Baie-Saint-Paul); Les Fromages de l'isle d'Orléans |
| **Lobster poutine** | Fresh-caught lobster over fries and curds --- the Maritime-Québécois mashup | Chez Mag (Île d'Orléans) |

### Restaurant Recommendations

**The Essentials (3-5 sources agree):**

| Restaurant | Location | Cuisine | Price | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Buffet de l'Antiquaire** | 95 Rue Saint-Paul, Old Port | Traditional Québécois | $-$$ | 40-year institution. Cipaille, meatball stew, cretons, baked beans. No-frills, family-recipe cooking. Jeans perfect. $12-25/person (Perplexity, Claude, Mistral) |
| **La Bûche** | 49 Rue Saint-Louis, Upper Town | Québécois / sugar shack | $$-$$$ | Tourtière, oreilles de crisse, pouding chômeur, maple-everything. Sugar-shack interior. Lively but can request table for two. $20-40/person (Perplexity, Claude, Gemini DT) |
| **Aux Anciens Canadiens** | 34 Rue Saint-Louis, Upper Town | Classic Québécois | $$-$$$ | In the historic Jacquet House (1675). Most comprehensive traditional menu in the city. Touristy but food is genuine. $25-45/person (Perplexity, Claude, Mistral) |
| **La Traite** | Hôtel-Musée Premières Nations, Wendake | Indigenous terroir | $$-$$$ | Venison, bison, boreal herbs, bannock. Glass atrium. One of the most respected restaurants in the region. $25+ CAD mains (Perplexity, Claude, Gemini DT) |

**Strong Mentions (2 sources):**

| Restaurant | Location | Cuisine | Notable |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Le Chic Shack** | 15 Rue du Fort, near Place d'Armes | Gourmet diner | Creative poutines (La Forestière with wild mushroom ragout), burgers, milkshakes. Ultra-casual. $12-22/person (Perplexity, ChatGPT) |
| **La Sagamité** | 10 Blvd Bastien, Wendake | Indigenous | Game meats flambéed at your table ("La Potence"). Sagamité soup, bannock. More casual than La Traite. $25-50/person (Claude, Gemini DT) |
| **Paillard** | 1097 Rue Saint-Jean | Bakery-café | Outstanding croissants, chocolatines, sandwiches, gelato. Opens early. Perfect daily breakfast base. $8-15/person (Claude, Perplexity) |
| **Le Billig** | 481 Rue Saint-Jean | Breton crêperie | Buckwheat galettes, wheat crêpes. Breton-owned. Duck confit crêpe and maple iced tea. $14-22/person (Claude) |
| **Chez Mag** | Île d'Orléans (Sainte-Famille) | Seasonal canteen | Famous lobster poutine. Roadside shack with picnic tables. $12-18/person. May through October only (Claude, Gemini DT) |
| **Ah La Vache!** | Baie-Saint-Paul | Swiss/fondue | Fondue served inside a giant bread bowl. Warm, unpretentious. Highly recommended by Charlevoix locals (Perplexity) |
| **Le Mouton Noir** | 86 Rue Saint-Jean-Baptiste, Baie-Saint-Paul | French-Canadian | Relaxed atmosphere. Duck, halibut, local ingredients. $$-$$$ (Perplexity) |

### A Note on Alcohol

Since this couple doesn't drink, Claude identifies a useful cultural fact: Quebec has a thriving "sans alcool" culture. Ordering bière d'épinette (a non-alcoholic spruce soda), artisanal berry sodas, or creative mocktails at any restaurant is completely normal. Nobody will bat an eye.

### Le Grand Marché de Québec

Quebec City's premier food market, near ExpoCité/Vidéotron Centre area (note: relocated from the Old Port). Local produce, seafood, artisan cheeses, maple products, tourtière, and regional specialties. Open daily. Low-commitment grazing, air-conditioned refuge on muggy days.

> **My take:** Buffet de l'Antiquaire is the one restaurant that delivers the most authentic traditional Québécois experience --- it's a 40-year-old diner where locals actually eat, not a tourist reconstruction. La Traite in Wendake is the single best restaurant on this itinerary --- combine it with the museum visit for a full cultural day. Paillard should be the default breakfast every morning --- the croissants are genuinely excellent and it opens early enough for a pre-dawn-patrol coffee. On the Charlevoix day, Ah La Vache! in Baie-Saint-Paul is the kind of lunch that makes a day trip memorable --- fondue in a bread bowl, eaten in a cozy dining room after 3 hours of Route 362 panoramas. And on the Île d'Orléans day, Chez Mag's lobster poutine at a roadside shack is the meal equivalent of the PEI lobster roll --- simple, local, perfect.

---

## Practical Consensus

### Park Passes

- **Parks Canada (Canada Strong Pass):** FREE admission to all national parks and national historic sites from June 19 to September 7, 2026. This covers Jacques-Cartier NP (if federally managed portions apply --- verify), Cap Tourmente NWA, and any national historic sites. No pass purchase needed
- **Provincial parks:** Sépaq manages most Quebec parks. Jacques-Cartier NP is Sépaq-managed (~$9-10 CAD/adult). Montmorency Falls is also Sépaq (~$7-10 CAD parking + cable car). These charge separately
- **Plains of Abraham Museum:** Free on Canada Day (July 1). Otherwise ~$16-18 CAD/adult

### Fuel

Gas stations are well-distributed. **Fill up in the US before crossing** --- fuel is significantly cheaper south of the border. Quebec gas averages ~$1.60-1.70 CAD/litre (~$4.40-4.65 USD/gallon). Fill before entering Jacques-Cartier NP. Fill in Jackman, ME before the Route 201 wilderness stretch on the return (services sparse).

### Cell Coverage

Reliable in Quebec City, along highways, and in Charlevoix towns. Spotty in Jacques-Cartier NP interior, northern Maine (Route 201), and rural Quebec (Beauce, Eastern Townships). **Download offline Google Maps** for Quebec City region, Charlevoix, and northern Maine before the trip. Most US carriers include Canada: T-Mobile (most plans) and AT&T (all unlimited plans) include Canada at no extra charge. Verizon TravelPass ~$5-10/day. Confirm and enable before crossing.

### Border Crossing

| Requirement | Status (2026) |
|---|---|
| Passport | Valid US passport or passport card (land crossings accept passport cards) |
| ArriveCAN | Discontinued --- not required |
| COVID vaccination | Not required |
| Visa/eTA | Not required for US citizens by land |
| Auto insurance | Carry proof |
| Food declaration | Declare all food items at border. CBSA emphasizes mandatory declaration with penalties for failure |

**Outbound crossing options:**
- **Stanstead / Derby Line, VT** (I-91): Larger, well-staffed, predictable wait times. 3/5 sources recommend
- **Chartierville** (from Pittsburg, NH via US-3): Rural, charming, very small. **Open 8 AM-8 PM only.** Gemini recommends

**Return crossing:**
- **Jackman / Armstrong, ME** (Route 201): Open 24 hours, ~500 vehicles/day, minimal wait. The consensus pick for an Old Canada Road return

**Camera gear at the border (Claude's unique detail):** Personal photography equipment for tourist use requires no declaration. Optionally file CBP Form 4457 at a US Customs office before departure to pre-register equipment serial numbers --- eliminates hassle on return.

### Currency

Credit and debit cards with contactless tap work virtually everywhere --- Quebec is heavily cashless. US dollars are **not reliably accepted** outside major tourist areas. Carry ~$100-150 CAD cash for markets, small food vendors, and farm stands. Notify your bank of Canadian travel to avoid card blocks.

### Language

Quebec City's tourist core is bilingual, but **outside Old Quebec, English proficiency drops sharply.** Wendake, Île d'Orléans, Baie-Saint-Paul, the Beauce, and rural Quebec are francophone. Start every interaction with "Bonjour" before asking "Parlez-vous anglais?" --- this is considered mandatory local courtesy, and locals respond very warmly to the effort. Download the Google Translate French language pack offline before heading to areas with spotty coverage.

### Driving

Speed limits in km/h: 100 km/h (62 mph) on Quebec autoroutes, 80-90 km/h (50-56 mph) on rural highways, 50 km/h (31 mph) in towns. Quebec's summer road construction is legendary --- check quebec511.info before each drive. Build 30 extra minutes into any drive time estimate.

### Budget Estimate

| Item | Estimated Cost (CAD) | USD Equivalent (~0.72) |
|---|---|---|
| Hotel PUR, 7 nights @ ~$175/night | $1,225 | ~$880 |
| Parking @ ~$25/night | $175 | ~$126 |
| Montmorency Falls (2 x parking + cable car) | $50 | ~$36 |
| Jacques-Cartier NP (2 x $10) | $20 | ~$14 |
| Canyon Sainte-Anne (2 x $15) | $30 | ~$22 |
| Mont-Sainte-Anne gondola (2 x $25) | $50 | ~$36 |
| Observatoire de la Capitale (2 x $15) | $30 | ~$22 |
| La Citadelle (2 x $22) | $44 | ~$32 |
| Musée de la civilisation (2 x $26) | $52 | ~$37 |
| Huron-Wendat Museum (2 x $20) | $40 | ~$29 |
| Onhoüa Chetek8e (2 x $18) | $36 | ~$26 |
| Onhwa' Lumina (2 x $34 + parking) | $79 | ~$57 |
| Lévis ferry (2 x $8 round trip) | $16 | ~$12 |
| Fuel (~1,800 km total) | $230 | ~$166 |
| Dining (2 meals/day out, 9 days) | $700-1,000 | ~$505-720 |
| **Total** | **~$2,777-3,077** | **~$2,000-2,215** |

## Source Quality Assessment

**Perplexity Deep Research** --- The most traditionally formatted travel guide with 81 footnoted references. Strongest on restaurant specifics (addresses, hours, pricing) and museum practical information. Good day-by-day structure with sensible sequencing. The photography section includes specific vantage points with lens recommendations and light-direction guidance for each major subject. Uniquely surfaces the Basilique interior photography opportunity and the Lévis ferry golden-hour strategy with clear operational instructions. Weakness: doesn't identify the cruise-ship gap or the MNBAQ construction closure; the Charlevoix section, while good, lacks Claude's Route de la Nouvelle-France alternative and Laiterie Charlevoix cheese-curds stop; doesn't flag FEQ stage construction starting before the festival.

**Claude.ai** --- The most architecturally sophisticated and analytically rigorous response. Six unique contributions of high value: (1) the Lake Willoughby / Northeast Kingdom scenic outbound through Vermont with stops at the Dog Chapel, Haskell Free Library, and North Hatley; (2) the Beauce return via Pont Perrault covered bridge, Attean Overlook, and Crawford Notch for no-overlap scenery; (3) the zero-cruise-ship intelligence for June 29-July 6; (4) the MNBAQ construction status (only Pierre Lassonde Pavilion open); (5) the Côte-de-Beaupré corridor day combining Montmorency Falls, Basilique, Canyon Sainte-Anne, and Mont-Sainte-Anne gondola into a single logical sequence; (6) the Onhwa' Lumina date confirmation within the trip window. The Hôtel Palace Royal recommendation with its kitchen/suite analysis is the most thorough lodging assessment. The Wendake day is the most complete (museum + traditional site + Kabir Kouba + La Sagamité + Onhwa' Lumina evening). The return-drive photography stops (Pont Perrault, Attean Overlook, Wyman Lake) transform the transit day. Weakness: the overall ambition assumes extraordinary stamina --- the Côte-de-Beaupré day (Montmorency at 6:30 AM, Basilica, Canyon, Mont-Sainte-Anne gondola, Lévis sunset) is a 14+ hour day; the "moving day" detail about 250,000 households is interesting but operationally irrelevant since the itinerary avoids affected areas.

**ChatGPT Deep Research** --- The most strategically rigorous and crowd-avoidance-focused response. Uses entity/citation markup for traceable sourcing. Four unique contributions: (1) the "time-shifting and location-shifting" framework that explicitly names the two crowd-avoidance levers; (2) the internet redundancy advice (travel router + phone hotspot) from an IT-professional perspective; (3) the Sépaq online-ticket-purchase recommendation for Montmorency Falls to reduce arrival friction; (4) the systematic hotel comparison across four properties with clear use-case labels. The museum and viewpoint sections include hours, accessibility, and pricing from official sources. Weakness: lighter on specific restaurant recommendations and photography technique than Perplexity and Claude; the Chemin du Roy return suggestion is underdeveloped; doesn't include Charlevoix or Île d'Orléans day-trip details at the same depth as the other sources.

**Gemini Deep Think** --- The most confrontational and assumption-challenging response. Five unique contributions: (1) the explicit "don't book a B&B in Old Quebec" argument with structural reasoning; (2) the Hôtel-Musée Premières Nations as the primary lodging recommendation --- the boldest call across all five sources; (3) the Chartierville border crossing through US-3 "Moose Alley" as an alternative to the standard I-91 corridor; (4) the Parc des Chutes-de-la-Chaudière in Lévis as a drive-up waterfall alternative; (5) the "sans alcool" culture note for non-drinkers. The FEQ timing caveat is appropriately cautious (notes uncertainty about exact 2026 dates). Weakness: the day-by-day itinerary is the shortest and least specific of the five; Charlevoix gets one day but without Route 362 detail; the Chartierville border crossing's 8 AM-8 PM restriction isn't flagged until late in the text; the Île d'Orléans day has minimal detail.

**Mistral Le Chat** --- The least detailed and most structurally compromised response. Two defensible contributions: (1) the Hôtel Manoir Victoria as an Old Quebec lodging option with pool/gym/spa; (2) the explicit table-format presentation for lodging, dining, and cultural sites that makes comparison easy. Weaknesses are significant: the overnight-split recommendation burns two extra transit days for a 5.5-hour drive, reducing destination time from 7 nights to 5; La Mauricie NP (2 hours west) and Plaisance NP (even further) are poor time investments when Jacques-Cartier is 30 minutes away; the day-by-day itinerary is generic ("local restaurants in nearby towns") with minimal specific addresses, hours, or pricing; Charlevoix --- arguably the signature day trip --- is entirely absent; the restaurant and cultural site tables lack the analytical depth of the other sources; the FEQ timing is stated with false uncertainty ("likely July 2 or July 9") when other sources confirm July 9-19.

## Recommended Itinerary Skeleton

Based on consensus with Claude's scenic routing, ChatGPT's crowd-avoidance framework, and Gemini's lodging philosophy:

**Day 1 --- Sunday, June 29: Drive Day.** Hooksett via I-93 N / I-91 N through Vermont. Optional: Lake Willoughby detour on Route 5A (add 45-60 minutes but gain a spectacular glacial-lake photography stop). Optional: Haskell Free Library at Derby Line (15 minutes, border-straddling building). Cross at Stanstead. A-55 N / A-20 W into Quebec City. Arrive by 5:00-6:00 PM. Check into hotel. Evening: light walk for orientation. Dinner at Paillard (bakery-café, $8-15/person) or neighbourhood exploration.
