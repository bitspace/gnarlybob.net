# Summer 2026 — Cross-Destination Comparison

Six destinations ranked against traveler parameters. All assessments derived from multi-LLM consensus reports (4-6 models per destination).

---

## Executive Summary

Six destinations. One couple. One week in early July. The comparison reveals a clear tiered structure rather than a single obvious winner --- the top three destinations each excel at different things, and the right choice depends on which traveler parameters the couple weights most heavily.

**Tier 1 — The Contenders:**
- **Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean** leads on photography, scenic drama, and overall "trip of a lifetime" potential. The fjord is unlike anything else on the shortlist. The trade-off is the longest drive and the deepest francophone immersion.
- **Quebec City** leads on breadth of experience, cultural depth, and calendar luck (zero cruise ships, pre-FEQ, pre-Construction Holiday). The most complete week-long destination on the list. The trade-off is that it's a city, not wilderness.
- **Moncton** leads on tidal drama, return-visit discovery potential, and the single most photographically precise opportunity (Hopewell Rocks at golden-hour low tide on July 2). The trade-off is that the couple has been here before.

**Tier 2 — Strong but Narrower:**
- **Riviere-du-Loup** delivers the best sunsets, the strongest Indigenous discovery (Putep't-awt), and the most relaxing pace. Narrower than the Tier 1 destinations but deeper where it matters.
- **Ithaca** delivers the densest waterfall photography in the northeast and the strongest dining scene per capita. The most accessible destination on the list. The trade-off is domestic rather than international discovery.

**Tier 3 — Qualified:**
- **Algonquin** is genuinely beautiful but structurally limited for non-hikers and non-paddlers. The surrounding Muskoka region fills the gap, but the park itself runs thin after 1.5-2 days.

## Scoring Overview

Each dimension rated 1-10 against the couple's stated parameters. These are not objective quality scores --- they measure fit for *this couple's specific preferences*.

| Dimension | Ithaca | Moncton | Quebec City | Saguenay | Algonquin | Riviere-du-Loup |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Scenic Drives** | 7 | 8 | 9 | 9 | 6 | 8 |
| **Photography** | 9 | 9 | 9 | 10 | 7 | 8 |
| **Crowd Avoidance** | 6 | 7 | 7 | 9 | 7 | 9 |
| **Dining** | 9 | 8 | 10 | 8 | 6 | 8 |
| **Cultural Heritage** | 8 | 8 | 10 | 8 | 7 | 8 |
| **Lodging Fit** | 8 | 9 | 8 | 9 | 8 | 8 |
| **July Conditions** | 7 | 8 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 9 |
| **Travel Logistics** | 9 | 7 | 8 | 6 | 6 | 7 |
| **Composite** | **7.9** | **8.0** | **8.8** | **8.4** | **6.8** | **8.1** |

> **Note:** Reading the Scores
> A 6 doesn't mean "bad" --- it means "adequate but not a strength for this couple." A 10 means "this destination is best-in-class for this dimension against these travelers." The composite is an unweighted average; the couple should weight according to their own priorities.

---

## Dimension 1: Scenic Drives

The couple's stated #1 activity. The ideal is a home base with radiating day-trip loops on back roads, coastal roads, and mountain passes.

### Rankings

**9 — Quebec City and Saguenay (tied)**

Quebec City delivers the most variety: Charlevoix's Route 362 (one of North America's great coastal drives, all drive-up viewpoints), Ile d'Orleans' 67 km farm loop, the Jacques-Cartier glacial valley, and the Cote-de-Beaupre heritage corridor. Four completely different landscapes within an hour. The Charlevoix drive alone justifies the score.

Saguenay delivers the most drama: the fjord's 300-metre cliffs, the Route des Rivieres along the Saint-Maurice River gorges, and the Charlevoix coast on the return. The fjord roads are not continuous panoramic highways (you descend to specific villages to see the water), but each village reveals the fjord as a dramatic surprise. The two-base strategy eliminates the backtracking that would otherwise dilute the driving experience.

**8 — Moncton, Riviere-du-Loup, and Ithaca cluster**

Moncton's Fundy Trail Parkway (30 km, 21 drive-up viewpoints, purpose-built for this couple) is the single best-designed scenic drive for non-hikers on the entire list. Add the PEI loop, the Fundy coast, and the Northumberland Strait boardwalks. The limitation is less variety in landscape type --- it's tidal coast in every direction.

Riviere-du-Loup's Route 132 coastal corridor is genuinely gorgeous --- island-studded estuary views, cabourons, heritage stone villages. The Charlevoix ferry day adds a completely different landscape. The limitation is that the driving is linear (out and back from the base) rather than looping.

Ithaca's Cayuga Lake loop, Seneca Lake corridor, and Finger Lakes National Forest deliver pastoral beauty and vineyard hillsides. The Mohawk Trail outbound and Vermont US-4 return are excellent transit drives. The limitation is that the region lacks the vertical drama or coastal sweep of the Canadian destinations.

**6 — Algonquin**

Algonquin's Highway 60 corridor is a single 56 km out-and-back road through boreal forest. It is genuinely beautiful, but all four sources agree: you cannot do a scenic driving loop inside the park. The surrounding Muskoka region (Lake of Bays loop, Bracebridge waterfalls) fills the gap but doesn't match the continuous scenic reward of the other destinations.

---

## Dimension 2: Photography Potential

The wife's primary creative activity. Tripod, filters, multiple lenses. The question is: what can this destination offer a serious landscape photographer?

### Rankings

**10 — Saguenay**

Two fundamentally different landscape engines (fjord + inland sea) that most single destinations cannot match. Morning mist on the fjord at dawn is this trip's signature opportunity --- 300-metre cliffs emerging from fog, available only to photographers willing to be at the wharf by 5 AM. Val-Jalbert delivers a 72-metre waterfall plus ghost village. The Charlevoix return adds coastal bluff panoramas. And the mist conditions cannot be replicated anywhere else in eastern North America south of Newfoundland.

**9 — Ithaca, Moncton, and Quebec City (tied)**

Ithaca is the densest waterfall photography destination in the northeast. Taughannock Falls (215-foot plunge, flat gorge trail), Eagle Cliff Falls (natural amphitheatre), and the Watkins Glen partial route (Mile Point Bridge turnaround) offer professional-grade subjects with manageable access. The Corning Museum of Glass adds an entirely different visual dimension.

Moncton delivers the single most photographically precise opportunity on the entire list: Hopewell Rocks on July 2, 2026, when low tide falls at 9:06 PM --- five minutes before sunset. Standing among 12-21 metre flowerpot sea stacks in full golden light on the exposed ocean floor. No other destination offers this kind of predictable, calendar-specific convergence. The Fundy Trail viewpoints, Cape Enrage lighthouse, and PEI's red cliffs add depth.

Quebec City delivers the widest range of photographic subjects: 400-year-old cobblestones at sunrise (empty streets, golden light on stone), Montmorency Falls with ND filter for silky water (83 metres, cable car access), Charlevoix's mountain-and-river panoramas, and the Quebec City skyline from the Levis ferry at sunset. The variety is unmatched.

**8 — Riviere-du-Loup**

The sunsets over the 15 km-wide St. Lawrence are world-class (National Geographic has cited this stretch). Parc national du Bic at low tide delivers seals, coves, and headlands. The Putep't-awt beluga observatory offers shore-based whale photography. The limitation is that the region's palette is narrower than the Tier 1 destinations --- estuary, tidal flats, and sunsets dominate.

**7 — Algonquin**

Morning mist on Lake of Two Rivers is legitimately stunning. The Spruce Bog Boardwalk offers unique ecological subjects. Ragged Falls with an ND filter is the waterfall fix. But the park's photographic range for non-hikers is constrained to the Highway 60 corridor, and the best mist photography happens before the day-use permit is valid (sunrise at 5:29 AM, permits valid at 7:00 AM). Killbear Provincial Park on Georgian Bay (Gemini's discovery) partially addresses this with the iconic Canadian Shield landscape.

---

## Dimension 3: Crowd Avoidance

The couple is extremely crowd-averse and socially anxious. This measures how effectively a destination enables avoiding peak-time tourist density.

### Rankings

**9 — Saguenay and Riviere-du-Loup (tied)**

Saguenay's natural remoteness (2.5 hours beyond Quebec City) filters out casual tourists even in peak season. The fjord villages are tiny (Sainte-Rose-du-Nord: population 450). Canada Day falls on a Wednesday in a province that doesn't celebrate it enthusiastically. The two-base strategy removes the couple from downtown Chicoutimi precisely when three music festivals launch. The Dawn Patrol at 4:50 AM sunrise gives 90+ minutes of solitude before anyone else arrives.

Riviere-du-Loup is inherently uncrowded. The region's remoteness (3 hours beyond Quebec City) keeps casual tourists away. Parc national du Bic and the Putep't-awt observatory have natural capacity limits but don't sell out. The casse-croute dining culture eliminates restaurant anxiety entirely. The one crowd event (Canada Day) is easily escaped by fleeing inland to Lac-Temiscouata.

**7 — Moncton, Quebec City, and Algonquin (tied)**

Moncton's main attractions (Hopewell Rocks, Fundy Trail) draw summer crowds, but the Dawn Patrol strategy and tide-dependent scheduling naturally distribute visitors. The Shediac Lobster Festival (July 4-12) is the one crowd trap to actively avoid. The Residence Inn's suite layout and downtown location eliminate the forced-social-interaction problem.

Quebec City's walled centre is the most tourist-dense location on the entire list --- but the couple's dawn patrol strategy (5:00 AM photography sessions) and the extraordinary calendar luck (zero cruise ships June 29-July 6, pre-FEQ, pre-Construction Holiday) transform it. The real experiences happen at the edges: Ile d'Orleans, Wendake, Charlevoix, Jacques-Cartier. Canada Day escape to Wendake is well-designed.

Algonquin's Highway 60 corridor is heavily visited in July, but the Dawn Patrol at 5:30 AM and weekday timing help. The Muskoka region outside the park is less crowded. The online-only permit system is the wild card --- it forces planning but also caps daily visitors.

**6 — Ithaca**

July in the Finger Lakes is peak season. Watkins Glen, Taughannock Falls, and Buttermilk Falls all draw significant crowds by 10-11 AM. The Dawn Patrol strategy is essential but doesn't fully mitigate the parking-lot-fills-and-trails-congest reality at marquee parks. The July 4 weekend is the worst --- all sources agree to avoid state parks entirely that day. Ithaca is the only domestic destination on the list, meaning it draws regional day-trippers who don't face the border-crossing friction that naturally filters crowds at Canadian destinations.

---

## Dimension 4: Dining

Casual dining, regional specialties, seafood when available. Jeans and t-shirts. What the locals eat, not what tourists are served.

### Rankings

**10 — Quebec City**

The deepest and most distinctive food culture on the list. Tourtiere, cipaille, poutine with squeaky curds, cretons on toast, pouding chomeur, oreilles de crisse --- an entire culinary vocabulary that exists nowhere else. The Indigenous terroir cuisine at La Traite in Wendake (venison, bison, boreal herbs, bannock) is one of the most respected restaurants in the region. Buffet de l'Antiquaire is a 40-year institution serving genuine Quebecois comfort food. Ile d'Orleans adds lobster poutine at roadside shacks and fresh strawberries from farm stands. The "sans alcool" culture means non-drinkers are completely at ease.

**9 — Ithaca**

The strongest dining scene per capita on the list. Boatyard Grill (waterfront seafood), Glenwood Pines (fish fry tradition), Moosewood (cultural institution), Maxie's (oyster bar) --- four sources agree on all four. The regional specialties are genuinely distinctive: salt potatoes, Cornell chicken, spiedies, fish fry. The Ithaca Farmers Market is outstanding. The Corning Museum area adds dining options on the day trip. The limitation is that it's upstate New York casual-American rather than a fundamentally different food culture.

**8 — Moncton, Riviere-du-Loup, and Saguenay (tied)**

Moncton delivers Maritime seafood at its finest: Alma Lobster Shop (from boat to plate), Tide & Boar (next door to the Residence Inn), and the genuine Acadian culinary traditions --- poutine rapee (entirely different from Quebec poutine), fricot, ployes, dulse. Chez Memere for poutine rapee is the one meal that will be completely new.

Riviere-du-Loup delivers the casse-croute culture at its most authentic: roadside snack bars with picnic tables, zero dress code, zero social pressure. Smoked eel from Poissonnerie Lauzier in Kamouraska is the region's signature delicacy. Cote Est (Michelin Bib Gourmand) is the one nicer meal. Cantine Cotiere near Bic won "Best Cantine in Quebec" in 2025.

Saguenay delivers the most regionally distinctive comfort food: tourtiere du Lac-Saint-Jean (deep-dish meat pie, radically different from the Montreal version), soupe aux gourganes (fava bean soup), and blueberry everything (the region produces 95% of Quebec's blueberries). Cantine Boivin's deep-fried cheese curds overlooking the Baie des Ha! Ha! is the mandatory stop. Fromagerie Perron's 4-year aged cheddar is legendary.

**6 — Algonquin**

The weakest dining scene on the list. The Huntsville/Muskoka region has serviceable restaurants --- Portuguese House, That Little Place by the Lights, Erika's Bakery --- but no distinctive regional food culture comparable to the other destinations. Butter tarts and Kawartha Dairy ice cream are pleasant but not a reason to travel. The Lake of Two Rivers Cafe inside the park offers basic poutine and burgers.

---

## Dimension 5: Cultural Heritage

Indigenous heritage museums and cultural centres. Local history. The couple has genuine interest in who lived here before and what the land meant to them.

### Rankings

**10 — Quebec City**

The deepest cultural heritage experience on the list, anchored by Wendake --- a living Huron-Wendat Nation community 20 minutes from downtown. The Huron-Wendat Museum (2,000+ objects, new permanent exhibition), Onhoua Chetek8e Traditional Huron Site (guided reconstructed village), La Traite restaurant (Indigenous terroir cuisine), and Onhwa' Lumina night walk (Moment Factory light/sound projections of creation myths) compose a full-day cultural arc unlike anything available at the other destinations. The Musee de la civilisation's "This Is Our Story" exhibition (developed with all 11 First Nations and Inuit peoples of Quebec) adds museum-grade depth. And the 400-year-old walled city itself is a UNESCO World Heritage Site --- the only fortified city in North America north of Mexico.

**8 — Ithaca, Moncton, Saguenay, and Riviere-du-Loup (tied)**

Ithaca's Ganondagan State Historic Site (Seneca Nation, National Historic Landmark, all 5 sources agree) is a non-negotiable destination. Ska-nonh Great Law of Peace Center and the Sullivan-Clinton Campaign markers add layers. The limitation is the 80-mile drive to Ganondagan.

Moncton's Metepenagiag Heritage Park (3,000+ years of Mi'kmaq history, remote and uncrowded) is the cultural discovery most likely to surprise the couple on a return visit. The M'pisun Awti'j Medicine Trail in Fundy National Park adds Indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants. Monument-Lefebvre tells the Acadian deportation story from the only community that survived it.

Saguenay's Musee Ilnu de Mashteuiatsh (Canadian Museums Association Award of Excellence) is an award-winning Indigenous cultural experience with guided outdoor visits, traditional camp with bannock and herbal tea, and the "Tshilanu Ilnuatsh" immersive exhibition. La Pulperie's "Chek8timi" exhibit adds archaeological depth.

Riviere-du-Loup's Putep't-awt observatory is simultaneously a wildlife experience and an Indigenous cultural experience --- opened in 2024 by the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk First Nation, named one of Time Magazine's most beautiful places. Parc national du Lac-Temiscouata adds 62 archaeological sites spanning 10,000 years.

**7 — Algonquin**

The Misko-Aki exhibit at the Muskoka Discovery Centre (designed entirely by an Indigenous curatorial circle) is nationally significant. The Algonquin Park Visitor Centre covers Algonquin Anishinaabe history. Waaseyaa Cultural Tours in Whitney (operated by a Madaoueskarini Algonquin woman) offers the deepest experience but requires 4-participant minimum and advance booking. The limitation is that Indigenous cultural experiences are dispersed across multiple locations rather than concentrated.

---

## Dimension 6: Lodging Fit

Non-negotiable: reliable high-speed internet, fitness facilities, privacy (no communal breakfasts, no B&B energy). Nice to have: pool, hot tub, kitchen, fridge.

### Rankings

**9 — Moncton and Saguenay (tied)**

Moncton's Residence Inn by Marriott (3/4 sources recommend) delivers the full package: suite with separate living area, full kitchenette (fridge, stovetop, dishwasher), indoor saltwater pool, hot tub, WiFi + wired Ethernet, complimentary hot breakfast (skippable), downtown walking distance to restaurants. 9.2/10 Expedia. The kitchen eliminates forced social interaction at meals.

Saguenay's OTL Gouverneur (4/5 sources recommend) is the highest-rated property on the list: Prestige Suite with 484 sq ft, very high-speed wired AND wireless internet, 24-hour professional gym, indoor saltwater pool, 2 hot tubs, PAUS Spa, Nespresso, heated bathroom floors, private Prestige floor. TripAdvisor #14 most luxury hotel in Canada. 9.6/10 Expedia. The included breakfast is communal (the one flaw), but the Nespresso and fridge enable skipping it.

**8 — Ithaca, Quebec City, Algonquin, and Riviere-du-Loup**

Ithaca's Hampton Inn (3/5 sources) is the safe, correct answer: indoor pool, 24hr fitness, free hot breakfast, free WiFi, fridge/microwave. Whirlpool room available. The limitation is that it's a standard Hampton --- no kitchen, no suite layout, no wired Ethernet.

Quebec City offers a three-way choice: Hotel PUR (modern, good gym, Saint-Roch district, 3/5 sources), Palace Royal (suite with kitchen and wired Ethernet, Claude's pick), or the bold outlier Hotel-Musee Premieres Nations in Wendake (Gemini's pick --- museum attached, zero tourist density, free parking, but $250-350/night). No single option hits every parameter.

Algonquin's Home2 Suites by Hilton in Huntsville (3/4 sources) is brand new (2023), with full kitchenette, Peloton gym, indoor saline pool, digital key. The limitation is the 38-minute drive to the park and no hot tub.

Riviere-du-Loup's Hotel Levesque (4/5 sources) has business-grade WiFi, fitness room, indoor pool, spa services, on-site restaurants, and river-view balcony rooms where the sunset is a photography experience. The limitation is no full kitchen and the gym closes at 10 PM.

---

## Dimension 7: July Conditions

Temperature, humidity, rain, bugs, crowd timing, and any calendar-specific advantages or hazards.

### Rankings

**9 — Quebec City and Riviere-du-Loup (tied)**

Quebec City's calendar alignment is genuinely extraordinary: zero cruise ships June 29-July 6, pre-FEQ (July 9), pre-Construction Holiday (July 19+), and Canada Day falls midweek in a province where it's better known as "Moving Day." Highs 24-26C (75-79F), 15+ hours of daylight, same time zone as New Hampshire. Bugs are a minor factor (some mosquitoes at Jacques-Cartier, manageable with DEET).

Riviere-du-Loup has the best pure weather on the list: highs 21-23C (70-73F) with constant estuary breeze, 16 hours of daylight at latitude 47.8N, and blackflies finished by early July. Pre-Construction Holiday, pre-peak season. The maritime influence keeps humidity comfortable. Bugs are minimal on the coast.

**8 — Moncton and Saguenay (tied)**

Moncton's Bay of Fundy coast is naturally cool (5-10C cooler than inland). The fog is a photographic asset, not a flaw. The critical timing variables are the Shediac Lobster Festival (July 4-12, avoid Shediac) and the tide table (governs access to every major attraction). Rain is brief, not all-day.

Saguenay is cooler than New Hampshire (highs 22-26C) with 50% daily rain chance but mostly afternoon showers --- mornings tend to be clear. Pre-Construction Holiday. Three music festivals in Chicoutimi July 2-3 are easily avoided. The 4:50 AM sunrise gives extraordinary Dawn Patrol windows. Bugs are moderate (blackflies done, mosquitoes active).

**7 — Ithaca and Algonquin (tied)**

Ithaca's highs (79-83F) are the warmest on the list, with moderate-to-high humidity (69-80%). Gorges are 10-15F cooler. Waterfall flow is the critical variable --- smaller streams can dry up in dry July spells. July 4 weekend is the worst crowd event on the entire list across all destinations. The 38% daily rain chance means scheduling flow-dependent waterfalls after rainfall.

Algonquin's weather is comparable to Saguenay but with a worse bug profile (mosquitoes active, deer flies emerging in early July). The online-only permit system (5 days in advance at 7:00 AM, non-refundable, can sell out) is the most operationally risky logistics element across all six destinations. The sunrise-vs-permit conflict (sunrise 5:29 AM, permits valid 7:00 AM) means missing the best mist photography.

---

## Dimension 8: Travel Logistics

Distance from Hooksett NH, border crossing complexity, language, permits/passes, and operational friction.

### Rankings

**9 — Ithaca**

The only domestic destination. 5.5 hours, no border, no currency conversion, no language barrier, no permit systems. The Empire Pass ($80) covers all NY State Parks. The simplest logistics on the list by a significant margin.

**8 — Quebec City**

5.5-7 hours depending on route. The Stanstead border crossing on I-91 is straightforward. Same time zone as New Hampshire. Language is manageable in the tourist core but drops off sharply outside Old Quebec. Parks are SEPAQ-managed with gate purchases available (no Algonquin-style online-only nightmare). The Old Canada Road return through Jackman, ME adds a scenic dimension to transit.

**7 — Moncton and Riviere-du-Loup (tied)**

Moncton is ~450 miles / 7.5 hours. The Houlton border crossing on I-95 is efficient. Atlantic Daylight Time (1 hour ahead) requires adjustment. Language is predominantly English in Moncton, mixed on the Acadian coast, French-only in rural areas. The tide table governs every major attraction --- not difficult but requires planning.

Riviere-du-Loup is ~380 miles / 6.5-7.5 hours. Same border crossing as Quebec City. The region is 99% francophone --- the deepest French immersion on the list after Saguenay. The Charlevoix ferry requires arriving 90 minutes early with no car reservations. SEPAQ parks recommend online booking for Bic to guarantee entry.

**6 — Saguenay and Algonquin (tied)**

Saguenay is the longest drive: 425-480 miles / 7.5-8.5 hours each way, with 4/5 sources recommending splitting the drive. The two-base strategy adds a mid-trip hotel transfer. The region is 98-99% francophone (0.8% anglophone). Cell coverage has dead spots on Route 175 and Route 172. The logistical complexity is the highest on the list --- but the payoff justifies it.

Algonquin is ~450 miles / 7-7.5 hours. The border crossing into Ontario is straightforward, but the online-only park permit system is uniquely punishing: purchase 5 days in advance at exactly 7:00 AM EST, non-refundable, can sell out on busy days. No in-person sales. Failure means getting turned away at the gate. Cell coverage inside the park is limited. Speed limits and signs switch to metric at the border.

## Head-to-Head Comparisons

### Quebec City vs. Saguenay: The Top Two

The two strongest destinations compete on different axes.

Quebec City wins on: breadth of experience (city + island + coast + valley + waterfall + Indigenous community), dining depth (the most distinctive food culture), cultural heritage (Wendake + Musee de la civilisation + UNESCO Old City), and logistics (shorter drive, same time zone, manageable language).

Saguenay wins on: photographic drama (the fjord at dawn is the single strongest landscape opportunity on the list), crowd avoidance (natural remoteness filters tourists), and the "once in a lifetime" factor --- this is the destination most likely to produce images and memories the couple cannot get anywhere else.

**The deciding question:** Does the couple want the richest possible week (Quebec City) or the most dramatic possible week (Saguenay)?

### Moncton vs. Riviere-du-Loup: The Return Visit vs. The Discovery

Both are hub-and-spoke bases on the Atlantic coast of Canada. Both deliver tidal landscapes, casual dining, and manageable logistics.

Moncton wins on: photographic precision (Hopewell golden-hour convergence), attraction density (Fundy Trail, Cape Enrage, Kouchibouguac, PEI, St. Andrews), and the familiar-territory comfort of a return visit.

Riviere-du-Loup wins on: crowd avoidance (inherently uncrowded), sunset quality (National Geographic-cited), Indigenous discovery (Putep't-awt), and the "new territory" factor --- everything will be a first impression.

**The deciding question:** Does the couple want to deepen a place they loved (Moncton) or discover a place they've only driven through (Riviere-du-Loup)?

### Ithaca vs. Algonquin: The Accessible Pick vs. The Wilderness Pick

Both are nature-forward destinations with limited urban infrastructure. Both require early mornings to beat crowds.

Ithaca wins on: waterfall density (more accessible waterfalls than anywhere else on the list), dining (strongest food scene), logistics (domestic, no border), and the Corning Museum of Glass (the single most valuable unique discovery across all six Ithaca research sources).

Algonquin wins on: wildlife (moose from the car, loons on lakes, Canada Jays from your hand), the Killbear Provincial Park day trip (Group of Seven landscape on Georgian Bay), and the sheer scale of boreal wilderness.

**The deciding question:** Does the couple want the most photographically productive week (Ithaca) or the most immersive wilderness experience (Algonquin)?

---

## The Recommendation

### If You Can Only Pick One: Quebec City

Quebec City scores highest on the composite and delivers the most complete week. The combination of a UNESCO World Heritage walled city at dawn, Charlevoix's Route 362, Ile d'Orleans' pastoral loop, Montmorency Falls with ND filter, Wendake's full-day Indigenous cultural arc, and Jacques-Cartier's glacial valley --- all within an hour of the hotel --- is unmatched by any other destination. The calendar alignment (zero cruise ships, pre-FEQ, pre-Construction Holiday) is genuinely fortunate and cannot be replicated in other years. The dining is the deepest. The cultural heritage is the richest. The logistics are the simplest of the Canadian options.

### If Photography Is the Priority: Saguenay

The fjord at dawn with mist is the single most dramatic landscape opportunity on the list. It cannot be replicated anywhere else in eastern North America south of the Arctic. The two-base strategy, the Val-Jalbert ghost village waterfall, the Charlevoix return drive, and the Les Escoumins shore-based whale watching compose a photographer's week that will produce portfolio-quality work. The trade-off (longest drive, deepest French immersion) is real but manageable.

### If the Calendar Allows Two Trips: Quebec City + Moncton

Quebec City for the first week of July 2026 (exploiting the cruise-ship gap and pre-FEQ timing), and Moncton for a separate trip timed around a Hopewell Rocks golden-hour low-tide convergence. These two destinations complement rather than overlap --- one is a European-flavoured city with pastoral day trips, the other is a tidal-coast wilderness with Maritime seafood culture.

### If Relaxation Matters More Than Ambition: Riviere-du-Loup

The most restorative destination on the list. World-class sunsets from the hotel balcony. Flat, accessible everything. Zero operational complexity. The casse-croute culture eliminates dining anxiety. The Putep't-awt observatory is a genuine cultural discovery. And the pace --- sunrise photography, midday rest, sunset photography, repeat --- matches this couple's natural rhythm better than any other destination.

## Open Questions for the Couple

1. **How much does language matter?** If francophone immersion adds stress rather than adventure, Ithaca and Moncton move up; Saguenay and Riviere-du-Loup move down.
2. **Is this trip about photography or about relaxation?** If photography: Saguenay or Quebec City. If relaxation: Riviere-du-Loup.
3. **How does "we've been there" factor in?** If novelty matters: Saguenay, Riviere-du-Loup, or Algonquin. If comfort matters: Moncton or Ithaca.
4. **Would the couple consider two shorter trips instead of one?** Quebec City in early July + Moncton timed to a Hopewell golden-hour convergence would be the optimal combined strategy.
5. **Is the July 2 Hopewell Rocks convergence (low tide at sunset) a deciding factor?** If yes, Moncton wins regardless of composite scores. That specific moment is unrepeatable.
